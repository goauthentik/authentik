## What is MinIO

> MinIO is an Amazon S3 compatible object storage suite capable of handling structured and unstructured data including log files, artifacts, backups, container images, photos and videos. The current maximum supported object size is 5TB.

## Preparation

The following placeholders are used in this guide:

- `minio.company` is the FQDN of the MinIO installation.
- `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik installation.

:::warning MinIO product changes
[MinIO](https://github.com/minio/minio) is in maintenance mode since December 2025. [MinIO AIStor Free](https://www.min.io/download) is its closed-source commercially licensed replacement; a full-featured, single-node deployment which supports SSO.

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of MinIO with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)
    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings. Note the **Slug** value because it will be required later.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
        - Note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values because they will be required later.
        - Set a `Strict` redirect URI to `https://minio.company/oauth_callback`.
        - Select any available signing key.
    - **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## MinIO configuration

You can set up OpenID in three different ways: via environment variables, the web interface, or the command line.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="environment-variables"
  values={[
    {label: 'Environment variables', value: 'environment-variables'},
    {label: 'Web interface', value: 'web-interface'},
    {label: 'Command line', value: 'command-line'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="environment-variables">

MinIO OpenID Connect configuration can be configured using [environment variables](https://docs.min.io/enterprise/aistor-object-store/reference/aistor-server/settings/iam/openid/?tab=role-policy-environment-variable).

Add the following variables to your environment file:

```yaml
MINIO_IDENTITY_OPENID_CONFIG_URL="https://authentik.company/application/o/<application_slug>/.well-known/openid-configuration"
MINIO_IDENTITY_OPENID_CLIENT_ID="<client id>"
MINIO_IDENTITY_OPENID_CLIENT_SECRET="<client secret>"
MINIO_IDENTITY_OPENID_DISPLAY_NAME="authentik"
MINIO_IDENTITY_OPENID_CLAIM_NAME="policy"
MINIO_IDENTITY_OPENID_SCOPES="openid,profile,email"
```

Redeploy MinIO AIStor for the changes to take effect.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="web-interface">

From the sidebar of the main page, go to **Access** > **OpenID**, click **Add Configuration**, and configure the following settings:

- **Name**: MinIO
- **Config URL**: `https://authentik.company/application/o/<application_slug>/.well-known/openid-configuration`
- **Client ID**: Your client ID from the previous step
- **Client Secret**: Your client secret from the previous step
- **Scopes**: `openid, email, profile`
- **Redirect URI**: `https://minio.company/oauth_callback`

Finally, click **Save** and follow the instructions in the popup to restart your instance.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="command-line">

You must install the MinIO binaries from [here](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html). You then need to create an alias for your instance using: `mc alias set myminio https://minio.company <access key> <secret key>`. You can follow [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/77645374) to create a secret key and access key.

After that is done, run the following command to configure the OpenID provider:

```
~ mc admin config set myminio identity_openid \
  config_url="https://authentik.company/application/o/<application_slug>/.well-known/openid-configuration" \
  client_id="<client id>" \
  client_secret="<client secret>" \
  scopes="openid,profile,email"
```

The [upstream MinIO docs on OIDC](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc-admin/mc-admin-config.html#openid-identity-management) indicate that the `client_secret` (and thus confidential client type) are optional depending on provider. Experimentally with a single-node MinIO instance, the client secret was required and worked without further issue.
