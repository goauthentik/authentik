## authentik configuration

To support the integration of osTicket with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)
    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings. Take note of the **slug** as it will be required later.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
        - Note the **Client ID** and **slug** values because they will be required later.
        - Set a `Strict` redirect URI to `https://osticket.company/osticket/api/auth/oauth2`.
        - Select any available signing key.
        - Under **Advanced Protocol Settings**:
            - **Subject Mode**: `Based on the User's Email`
    - **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## osTicket configuration

1. Download the OAuth2 plugin from [the osTicket website](https://osticket.com/download) and place it into the `include/plugins` folder of your osTicket installation.
2. Log in to osTicket as an administrator, and navigate to the **Admin Panel**.
3. Navigate to **Manage** > **Plugins**.
4. Click **Add New Plugins** and follow the on-screen instructions to install the OAuth2 plugin.
5. Once installed, click on the newly installed OAuth2 plugin, set **Status** to `Active`, then click **Save Changes**.
6. Navigate to **Instances**, click on **Add New Instance**, select **OAuth2 - Other**, and set the following fields:
    - On the **Instance** tab:
        - Set a **Name**.
        - Set **Status** to `Enabled`.
    - On the **Config** tab:
        - **Name**: `authentik`
        - **Authentication Target**: `Agents Only` or `End Users Only` or `Agents and End Users`
        - **Authentication Label**: `authentik`
        - **Redirect URI**: `https://osticket.company/osticket/api/auth/oauth2`
        - **Client Id**: Set the Client ID from authentik.
        - **Client Secret**: Set the Client secret from authentik.
        - **Authorization Endpoint**: `https://authentik.company/application/o/authorize/`
        - **Token Endpoint**: `https://authentik.company/application/o/token/`
        - **Resource Details Endpoint**: `https://authentik.company/application/o/userinfo/`
        - **Scopes**: `email openid profile`

7. Click on **Save Changes**.

## Configuration verification

To verify that authentik is correctly integrated with osTicket, first log out of your account. Then, log back in using the **Sign in with authentik** button. You should be redirected to your authentik instance and after successfully authenticating, you should be redirected to osTicket and logged in.
