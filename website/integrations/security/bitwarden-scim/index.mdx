## Bitwarden configuration

1. Log in to the [Bitwarden dashboard](https://vault.bitwarden.com/#/login) as an administrator (choose `Accessing: bitwarden.eu` for Bitwarden accounts based in the EU). If you are using a self-hosted Bitwarden, go to `https://bitwarden.company/#/login`.
2. In the sidebar, navigate to **Admin Console** > **Settings** >

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Bitwarden SCIM with authentik, you need to create two property mappings and a SCIM provider in authentik.

### Create property mappings

Bitwarden SCIM requires two property mappings; user and group.

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Customization** > **Property Mappings**, click **Create** and configure the user property mapping.
    - **Select type**: select **SCIM Provider Mapping**.
    - **Configure the SCIM Provider Mapping**:
        - **Name**: Provide a descriptive name (e.g. `Bitwarden SCIM User Mapping`).
        - **Expression**:

        ```python showLineNumbers
        return {
            "userName": request.user.email,
            "displayName": request.user.name,
            "active": request.user.is_active,
            "emails": [{
                "value": request.user.email,
                "primary": True,
            }],
            "externalId": request.user.email,
        }
        ```

3. Click **Finish** to save the property mapping.
4. Click **Create** and configure the group property mapping:
    - **Select type**: select **SCIM Provider Mapping**.
    - **Configure the SCIM Provider Mapping**:
        - **Name**: Provide a descriptive name (e.g. `Bitwarden SCIM User Mapping`).
        - **Expression**:

        ```python showLineNumbers
        return {
            "displayName": group.name,
            "members": [
            {
                "userName": user.email,
                "displayName": user.name,
                "active": user.is_active,
                "emails": [{
                "value": user.email,
                "primary": True,
                }],
            } for user in group.users.all()],
        "externalId": group.name,
        }
        ```

5. Click **Finish** to save the property mapping.
