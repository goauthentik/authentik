## What is AWS

> AWS, or Amazon Web Services, is a comprehensive cloud computing platform. It provides a wide array of on-demand IT services like computing power, storage, and databases, allowing businesses to build and run applications, and manage infrastructure through the internet.

## Preparation

The following placeholders are used in this guide:

- `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik installation.

:::info
This documentation lists only the settings that you need to change from their default values. Be aware that any changes other than those explicitly mentioned in this guide could cause issues accessing your application.
:::

## Configuration methods

AWS Classic IAM can be integreated with authentik via SAML or OIDC. Below are the steps to configure each method.

:::info SCIM Provisioning Limitation
SCIM Provisioning is only supported in conjunction with [IAM Identity Center](../aws/index.mdx), not Classic IAM.

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of AWS with authentik via the Classic IAM method, you need to create two property mappings and an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create property mappings

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Customization** > **Property Mappings**, click **Create**, select **SAML Provider Property Mappings**, and click **Next**.
3. Configure the first mapping for the user's _role assignment_:
    - **Name**: provide a descriptive name
    - **SAML Attribute Name**: `https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/Role`
    - **Friendly Name**: Leave blank
    - **Expression**: Choose one of these options:

        For a static role:

        ```python
        return "arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_ID>:role/saml_role,arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_ID>:saml-provider/authentik"
        ```

        For role assignment based on group membership:

        ```python
        role_name = user.group_attributes().get("aws_role", "")
        return f"arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_ID>:role/{role_name},arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_ID>:saml-provider/authentik"
        ```

        For multiple roles:

        ```python
        return [
            "arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_ID>:role/role_a,arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_ID>:saml-provider/authentik",
            "arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_ID>:role/role_b,arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_ID>:saml-provider/authentik",
            "arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_ID>:role/role_c,arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_ID>:saml-provider/authentik",
        ]
        ```

4. Click **Finish** to save. Then, repeat the process to create a mapping for the user's _session name_:
    - **Name**: provide a descriptive name
    - **SAML Attribute Name**: `https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/RoleSessionName`
    - **Friendly Name**: Leave blank
    - **Expression**: `return user.username`

5. Click **Finish**.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)
    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name (e.g. "AWS"), an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings. The **slug** will be used in URLs and should match the `aws-slug` placeholder defined earlier.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **SAML Provider** as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), and configure the following required settings:
        - Set the **ACS URL** to `https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml`
        - Set the **Audience** to `urn:amazon:webservices`
        - Under **Advanced protocol settings**, add both property mappings you created in the previous section
        - NAME ID EDIT
    - **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

:::note
The NameID field of type email is matched in AWS against the AWS username attribute, not the email attribute.
:::

### Download metadata file

1. Log into authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Providers** and click on the name of the newly created AWS provider.
3. Under **Related objects** > **Metadata**, click **Download**. This metadata file will be required in the next section.

## AWS configuration

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console as an administrator that has permissions to create IAM roles and identity providers.
2. Create an IAM role with the desired permissions and note the ARN.
3. Navigate to [IAM Identity Providers](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/providers).
4. Click **Create Provider** and configure:
    - Select **SAML** as the provider type.
    - Upload the metadata file from authentik.
5. Add the property mappings to the SAML Provider.
6. Create an application and assign the appropriate policies.
7. Connect the provider to your application.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with IAM Identity Center enabled

:::info AWS OIDC limitations
AWS does not support direct OIDC login for the AWS Management Console.

OIDC in AWS is mainly used for federated access to AWS resources and programmatic access, such as:

    - Machine-to-machine authentication (CI/CD pipelines, automated scripts, etc.)
    - Web applications requesting temporary AWS credentials via OIDC tokens
    - Service account integrations in Kubernetes clusters (like EKS OIDC provider)

:::

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of AWS with authentik using OIDC, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)
    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name (e.g., `AWS-OIDC`), an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: Select OAuth2/OpenID Provider as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
        - Note the **Client ID** and **slug** values because they will be required later.
        - Set a `Strict` redirect URI to match the AWS resource that you want to access via OIDC.
        - Select any available signing key.
    - **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## AWS configuration

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console as an administrator that has permissions to create IAM roles and identity providers.
2. Open the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/) and in the left sidebar under **Access Management**, click **Identity providers**.
3. Click **Add provider** and configure the following fields:
    - **Provider type**: `OpenID Connect`
    - **Provider URL**: `https://authentik.company/application/o/<application-slug>/`
    - **Audience**: set to the Client ID from authentik
4. Click **Add provider**
5. On the **Identity providers** page, click on the name of the provider that you just added.
6. Click **Assign role** and either create a new role or select an existing role. This will determine the AWS permissions of any user authenticated via OIDC.
