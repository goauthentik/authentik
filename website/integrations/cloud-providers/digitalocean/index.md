## Preparation

The following placeholders are used in this guide:

- `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik installation.

:::note
This documentation lists only the settings that you need to change from their default values. Be aware that any changes other than those explicitly mentioned in this guide could cause issues accessing your application.

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of DigitalOcean with authentik, you need to create a scope mapping as well as an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create a scope mapping

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Customization** > **Property Mappings** and click **Create**.
3. Click **Scope Mapping**, **Next**, and fill the following required information:
    - **Name**: Set an appropriate name
    - **Scope name**: `profile`
    - **Expression**:

    ```py
    # Extract the names of all groups the user belongs to
    group_names = user.ak_groups.values_list("name", flat=True)

    # From the group names, filter out those that start with "do:"
    # Strip off the "do:" prefix so we’re left with just the role name
    do_roles = [n[3:] for n in group_names if n and n[:3].casefold() == "do:"]

    # You can find all predefined roles at: https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/roles/predefined/
    # You can find documentation for custom roles at: https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/roles/custom/
    priority = ["Owner", "Admin", "Member"]

    # Pick the first matching role based on priority order
    # (e.g. if user has both "do:Admin" and "do:Member", they'll get "Admin")
    chosen = next((r for p in priority for r in do_roles if r == p), None)

    # Return a dict with the team role if one was chosen, otherwise return an empty dict
    return {"team_role": [chosen]} if chosen else {}
    ```

4. Click **Finish**.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)
    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
        - Note the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **slug** values because they will be required later.
        - Set a `Strict` redirect URI to `https://cloud.digitalocean.com/sessions/sso/callback`.
        - Select any available signing key.
        - Under **Advanced protocol settings**:
            - Add the `profile` scope created in the previous section. Do not remove authentik’s `authentik default OAuth Mapping: OpenID 'profile'`, as claims such as `name` are required by DigitalOcean.
    - **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## DigitalOcean configuration

1. Log in to the [DigitalOcean control panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/) as an administrator.
2. Navigate to **Settings** (bottom left) > **Single sign-on (OIDC)**, then click **Create**.
3. Configure the following required settings:
    - **OpenID provider URL**: `https://authentik.company/application/o/<application_slug>/`
    - **OpenID client ID**: Set the client ID from authentik.
    - **OpenID client secret**: Set the client secret from authentik.
4. Click **Test SSO config to continue**.
5. Optionally toggle **Require sign-in via SSO only**, then click **Continue**.
6. Take note of the **SSO sign-in URL**, then click **Save SSO**.

## Set the Start URL in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications**, then select your DigitalOcean application.
3. Click **Edit**, expand **UI Settings**, and set **Launch URL** to the **SSO sign-in URL** copied from the DigitalOcean control panel.
4. Click **Update**.

## Configuration verification

To verify the integration of authentik with DigitalOcean, navigate to the authentik User interface and click the DigitalOcean application to initiate a Single Sign-On login. Upon successful login, you should be redirected to the DigitalOcean dashboard and have the appropriate permissions set by your authentik groups.
