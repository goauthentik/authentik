## authentik configuration

To support the integration of _Service_ with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

_Any specific info about this integration can go here._

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can create only an application, without a provider, by clicking **Create**.)

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - _If there are any specific settings required, list them here. Refer to the [ownCloud integration documentation](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/blob/main/website/integrations/services/owncloud/index.md) for a complex requirements example._
- **Choose a Provider type**
    - _If there is a specific provider type required, state that here._
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    - _If there are any specific settings required, list them here. Refer to the [ownCloud integration documentation](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/blob/main/website/integrations/services/owncloud/index.md) for a complex requirements example._
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## Configuration verification

Template sentence that you can typically use here: "To confirm that authentik is properly configured with _Service Name_, log out and log back in via authentik."

If there are more specific validation methods for the Service (e.g., clicking a button), include these instructions for clarity.
