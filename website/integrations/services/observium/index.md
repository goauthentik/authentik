## Preparation

The following placeholders will be used:

-   `observium.company` is the FQDN of the Observium install.
-   `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik install.

This guide assumes you already have a working Observium instance. It is recommended to install it with the install script, following the [instructions](https://docs.observium.org/) on Observium's website.

Apache2 comes bundled with Observium, but there is also a third party module, [mod_auth_openidc](https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc), which is needed for this configuration to work.
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/releases) of the project suitable for your machine.

This guide uses `libapache2-mod-auth-openidc_2.4.15.7-1.bookworm_amd64.deb` as an example.

Install the package:

```bash
apt install ./libapache2-mod-auth-openidc_2.4.15.7-1.bookworm_amd64.deb
```

## authentik configuration

1. In authentik, under **Providers**, create an **OAuth2/OpenID Provider** with these settings:

    - Name: Observium
    - Client ID: Copy this for later
    - Client Secret: Copy this for later
    - Redirect URIs/Origins: `https://observium.company/secure/redirect_uri` (This can be any location on the domain that doesn't point to actual content)
    - Signing Key: Select any available signing key

2. In authentik, under **Applications**, create an Application with these settings:

    - Name: Observium
    - Slug: observium
    - Provider: Select `Observium`

## Observium configuration

1. Edit the file `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf` and add the following lines:

    ```apacheconf
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ...

        OIDCProviderMetadataURL https://authentik.company/application/o/observium/.well-known/openid-configuration
        OIDCClientID <Client ID>
        OIDCClientSecret <Client Secret>
        OIDCRedirectURI https://observium.company/secure/redirect_uri
        OIDCCryptoPassphrase <Random string for security>
        OIDCCookieDomain observium.company
        OIDCXForwardedHeaders X-Forwarded-Host X-Forwarded-Proto
        OIDCPathScope "openid email profile"
        OIDCRemoteUserClaim preferred_username ^(.*)$ $1@authentik

        <Location />
        AuthType openid-connect
        Require valid-user
        </Location>

        ...
    </VirtualHost>
    ```

    Meaning of variables:

    - `OIDCRedirectURI` is the same URI that is set for the authentik Provider.
    - The `OIDCCryptoPassphrase` directive should be set to a random string, for more information, see [the official documentation](https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/blob/9c0909af71eb52283f4d3797e55d1efef64966f2/auth_openidc.conf#L15).
    - `OIDCXForwardedHeaders` is necessary if your instance is behind a reverse proxy. If omitted, the module does not accept information from these headers.
    - `OIDCRemoteUserClaim` tells the module how to construct a username based on your claims. The first argument selects the claim, while the second and third are RegEx search and replace expressions. [More info](https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/blob/9c0909af71eb52283f4d3797e55d1efef64966f2/auth_openidc.conf#L794)

2. Edit the Observium configuration. By default, it should be located at `/opt/observium/config.php`.

    Edit the following line:

    ```php
    $config['auth_mechanism'] = "remote";
    ```

    Add the following lines:

    ```php
    $config['auth_remote_userlevel'] = 10;
    $config['auth_remote_logout_url'] = "https://authentik.company/application/o/observium/end-session/";
    ```

    With this method, you can only assign one permission level to all users. Since Observium permits only a single authentication mechanism to be selected, it is recommended to set `auth_remote_userlevel` to 10. You can read about all of the user levels [here](https://docs.observium.org/user_levels/).

3. Restart the Apache2 service:

    ```bash
    service apache2 restart
    ```

    Now you should be able to log in to your Observium instance using authentik.
