## What is Apache Guacamole™

> Apache Guacamole is a clientless remote desktop gateway. It supports standard protocols like VNC, RDP, and SSH.

## Preparation

The following placeholders are used in this guide:

- `guacamole.company` is the FQDN of the Guacamole installation.
- `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik installation.

:::note
This documentation lists only the settings that you need to change from their default values. Be aware that any changes other than those explicitly mentioned in this guide could cause issues accessing your application.

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Apache Guacamole with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
- **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    - Note the **Client ID**,**Client Secret**, and **slug** values because they will be required later.
    - Set a `Strict` redirect URI to <kbd>https://<em>guacamole.company</em>/</kbd>. If you have configured [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) to run Apache Guacamole on a subpath, you will need to update this value accordingly.
    - Select any available signing key.
    - Note that Apache Guacamole does not support session tokens longer than 300 minutes (5 hours).
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## Guacamole configuration

It is recommended you configure an admin account in Guacamole before setting up SSO to make things easier. Create a user in Guacamole using the username of your user in authentik and give them admin permissions. Without this, you might lose access to the Guacamole admin settings and have to revert the settings below.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs
  defaultValue="docker"
  values={[
    { label: 'Docker', value: 'docker' },
    { label: 'Standalone', value: 'standalone' },
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="docker">
    The Docker containers are configured via environment variables. The following variables are required:

```yaml
OPENID_AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT: https://authentik.company/application/o/authorize/
OPENID_CLIENT_ID: # client ID from above
OPENID_ISSUER: https://authentik.company/application/o/*Slug of the application from above*/
OPENID_JWKS_ENDPOINT: https://authentik.company/application/o/*Slug of the application from above*/jwks/
OPENID_REDIRECT_URI: https://guacamole.company/ # This must match the redirect URI above
OPENID_USERNAME_CLAIM_TYPE: preferred_username
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="standalone">
    Standalone Guacamole is configured using the `guacamole.properties` file. Add the following settings:

```
openid-authorization-endpoint=https://authentik.company/application/o/authorize/
openid-client-id=# client ID from above
openid-issuer=https://authentik.company/application/o/*Slug of the application from above*/
openid-jwks-endpoint=https://authentik.company/application/o/*Slug of the application from above*/jwks/
openid-redirect-uri=https://guacamole.company/ # This must match the redirect URI above
openid-username-claim-type=preferred_username
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Self Signed Certificates

When using a self-signed certificate, it is necessary to incorporate the certificate of the corresponding Certificate Authority into both the `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` file and the `/opt/java/openjkd/jre/lib/security/cacerts` keystore on your Apache Guacamole host. This ensures that the self-signed certificate is trusted by both the system and the Java runtime environment used by Guacamole.

#### Adding Certificate Authority certificate as trusted in `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`

:::note
This section depends on the operating system hosting Apache Guacamole.
:::

##### For _Debian_ based operating systems:

1. Copy the certificate of the Certificate Authority (e.g. `<CA_certificate>.crt`) to the `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` directory on the Apache Guacamole host. Ensure that the file extension is `.crt`.

2. To add the certificate as trusted in `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`, use the following command:

```shell
update-ca-certificates
```

##### For _Synology_ systems:

1. Copy the certificate of the Certificate Authority (e.g. `<CA_certificate>.crt`) to the `/usr/syno/etc/security-profile/ca-bundle-profile/ca-certificates/` directory on the Synology host. Ensure that the filetype is `.crt`.

2. To add the certificate as trusted in `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`, use the following command:

```shell
update-ca-certificates.sh
```

#### Adding Certificate Authority certificate to `/opt/java/openjkd/jre/lib/security/cacerts`

1. To export the certificate of the Certificate Authority, use the following command on the Certificate Authority host:

```shell
openssl pkcs12 -export -in <CA_certificate>.crt -inkey <CA_certificate>.key -out <CA_certificate>.p12 -passout pass:<password>
```

2. To import the certificate to the `/opt/java/openjdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts` keystore on the Apache Guacamole host, use the following command:

```shell
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore <CA_certificate>.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -keystore /opt/java/openjdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts -deststorepass <destination_store_password> -nopromt -srcstorepass <password>
```

:::note
More information on the keytool command can be found in the [Oracle documentation.](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/specs/man/keytool.html)
