-   `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik install.

## authentik configuration

Create an application and an OAuth2/OpenID provider, using the authentik Wizard.

1.  Log into authentik as an admin, and navigate to **Applications --> Applications**, and then click **Create with Wizard**.

2.  In the Wizard, follow the prompts to create an application and its provider.

    Create the application with these settings:

    -   Select OIDC as the provider type.
    -   Ensure that the **Redirect URI Setting** is left empty.

    Create the provider with these settings:

        -   Redirect URI: `https://vcenter.company/ui/login/oauth2/authcode`
        -   Ensure that a signing key is selected, for example the Self-signed Certificate.

3.  Click **Submit** to create the application and provider, and then click **Close** to close the Wizard.

Optionally, you can use a policy to apply access restrictions to the application.
