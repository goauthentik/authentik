## What is Kimai

> Kimai is a free & open source timetracker. It tracks work time and prints out a summary of your activities on demand. Yearly, monthly, daily, by customer, by project â€¦ Its simplicity is its strength. Due to Kimai's browser based interface it runs cross-platform, even on your mobile device.

## Preparation

The following placeholders will be used:

-   `kimai.company` is the FQDN of the Kimai Install
-   `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik Install
-   `admin.group` is the authentik group to be made Admin in Kimai

Create an application in authentik and use the slug for later as `<application-slug>`.

Create a SAML provider with the following parameters:

-   ACS URL: `https://kimai.company/auth/saml/acs`
-   Audience: `https://kimai.company/auth/saml`
-   Issuer: `https://authentik.company`
-   Binding: `Post`

Under _Advanced protocol settings_, set a certificate for _Signing Certificate_.

## Kimai Configuration

Paste the following block in your `local.yaml` file, after replacing the placeholder values from above. The file is usually located in `/opt/kimai/config/packages/local.yaml`.

To get the value for `x509cert`, go to _System_ > _Certificates_, and download the public Signing Certificate. To avoid further problems, concat it into "string format" using e.g.: https://www.samltool.com/format_x509cert.php

# Optionally add this for docker debug-logging

#   handlers:
#     main:
#       path: php://stderr
