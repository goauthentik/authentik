## What is Kimai

> Kimai is a free & open source timetracker. It tracks work time and prints out a summary of your activities on demand. Yearly, monthly, daily, by customer, by project â€¦ Its simplicity is its strength. Due to Kimai's browser based interface it runs cross-platform, even on your mobile device.

## Preparation

The following placeholders are used in this guide:

- `kimai.company` is the FQDN of the Kimai Install
- `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik Install
- `admin.group` is the authentik group to be made Admin in Kimai

:::note
This documentation lists only the settings that you need to change from their default values. Be aware that any changes other than those explicitly mentioned in this guide could cause issues accessing your application.

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Kimai with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can create only an application, without a provider, by clicking **Create**.)

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings. Take note of the **slug** as it will be required later.
- **Choose a Provider type**: select **SAML Provider** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    - Set the **ACS URL** to <kbd>https://<em>kimai.company</em>/auth/saml/acs</kbd>.
    - Set the **Audience** to <kbd>https://<em>kimai.company</em>auth/saml</kbd>.
    - Set the **Issuer** to <kbd>https://<em>authentik.company</em></kbd>.
    - Set the **Service Provider Binding** to `Post`.
    - Under **Advanced protocol settings**, select an available signing certificate.
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## Kimai Configuration

Paste the following block in your `local.yaml` file, after replacing the placeholder values from above. The file is usually located in `/opt/kimai/config/packages/local.yaml`.

To get the value for `x509cert`, go to _System_ > _Certificates_, and download the public Signing Certificate. To avoid further problems, concat it into "string format" using e.g.: https://www.samltool.com/format_x509cert.php

#   handlers:
