## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Pangolin with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)

    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
        - Note the **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** values because they will be required later.
        - Temporarily set **Redirect URI** to `https://temp.temp`.
        - Select any available signing key.
    - **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## Pangolin configuration

1. Log in to Pangolin as an administrator.
2. Navigate to **Server Admin** > **Identity Providers**, and click **Add Identity Provider**.

    - Under **General Information**:
        - **Name**: `authentik`
        - **Auto Provision Users** _(optional)_: enable this option for authentik users to be automatically provisioned in Pangolin on first login.
    - Under **OAuth2/OIDC Configuration**:
        - **Client ID**: Client ID from authentik.
        - **Client Secret**: Client Secret from authentik.
        - **Authorization URL**: `https://authentik.company/application/o/authorize/`
        - **Token URL**: `https://authentik.company/application/o/token/`

3. Click **Create Identity Provider**.
4. Under **General Information**, take note of the **Redirect URI** value because it will be required in the next section.

## Reconfigure authentik provider

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Providers** and click the **Edit** icon of the newly created Pangolin provider.
3. Set the **Redirect URI** to the value taken from Pangolin (e.g. `https://pangolin.company/auth/idp/<identity-provider-number>/oidc/callback`).
4. Click **Update**.

## Configuration verification

To confirm that authentik is properly configured with Pangolin, log out and log back in via the **authentik** login button.
