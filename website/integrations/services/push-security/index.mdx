## What is Push Security

> Push is a browser-based identity security platform that hardens and monitors your identity attack surface. Security teams can monitor and secure their entire identity attack surface (ISPM) and detect and block identity-based attacks (ITDR) such as advanced phishing techniques.

## Preparation

The following placeholders are used in this guide:

- `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik installation.

:::note
This documentation lists only the settings that you need to change from their default values. Be aware that any changes other than those explicitly mentioned in this guide could cause issues accessing your application.

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Push Security with authentik, you need to create a property mapping, and an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create a property mapping

Push Security requires a first and last name for each user. By default authentik only provides a full name, as a single string value. Therefore you need to create a property mapping to provide first and last names to Push Security.

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Customization** > **Property Mappings** and click **Create**.

    - **Select type**: select **Scope Mapping** as the property mapping type.
    - **Configure the Scope Mapping**: Provide a descriptive name (e.g. `Push Security Profile Scope`), and an optional description.

        - **Scope name**: `profile`
        - **Expression**:

        ```python showLineNumbers
        return {
            "name": request.user.name,
            "preferred_username": request.user.username,
            "nickname": request.user.username,
            "groups": [group.name for group in request.user.ak_groups.all()],
            "last_name": request.user.name.rsplit(" ", 1)[-1],
            "first_name": request.user.name.rsplit(" ", 1)[0],
        }
        ```

3. Click **Finish** to save the property mapping.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)

    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **SAML Provider** as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
        - Temporarily set the **ACS URL** and **Audience** to `https://temp.temp`
        - Set the **Service Provider Binding** to `Post`.
        - Under **Advanced protocol settings**:
            - Set an available signing certificate.
            - **Scopes**:
                - Remove `authentik default OAuth Mapping: OpenID 'profile'` from **Selected Scopes**.
                - Add the scope that you created in the previous section (e.g. `Push Security Profile Scope`) to **Selected Scopes**.

- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

### Download the signing certificate and copy the metadata URL

1. Log into authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Providers** and click on the name of the newly created Push Security provider.
3. Under **Download signing certificate** click the **Download** button. The contents of this certificate will be required in the next section.
4. Under **Metadata** click **Copy download URL**. This metadata URL will be required in the next section.

## Push Security configuration

1. Log in to the Push Security admin console.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Organization**.
3. Under **SAML configuration** click **Setup** and
4. Click **Setup** or go to the provider URL.
5. Click **Get Started**, select **Custom SAML**, and click **Next**.
6. Copy the displayed `Single Sign-On URL` and `Service Provider Entity URL`. They will be required in the next section.
7. Click **Next**.
8. Select **Manual** and set the **Single Sign-On Login URL** to `https://authentik.company/application/saml/<application slug>/sso/binding/init/`
9. Click **Upload signing certificate** and select the certificate downloaded from authentik.
10. _Optional_ under **Advanced Settings**, enable **Sign request**, and download the certificate.
11. Click **Next**.

## Reconfigure authentik provider

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Providers** and click the **Edit** icon of the newly created Push Security provider.
3. Under **Protocol settgins**, set the following required configurations:
    - **ACS URL**: set the acs url to the copied `Single Sign-On URL` (e.g. https:).
    - **Audience**: set the audience to the copied `Service Provider Entity URL` (e.g. https:).
    - _Optional_ add verification certificate
4. Click **Update**
