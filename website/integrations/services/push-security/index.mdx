## What is Push Security

> Push is a browser-based identity security platform that hardens and monitors your identity attack surface. Security teams can monitor and secure their entire identity attack surface (ISPM) and detect and block identity-based attacks (ITDR) such as advanced phishing techniques.

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Push Security with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
- **Choose a Provider type**: select **SAML Provider** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    - Temporarily set the **ACS URL** and **Audience** to `https://temp.temp`
    - Under **Advanced protocol settings**, set an available signing certificate.
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

### Download the signing certificate and copy the metadata URL

1. Log into authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Providers** and click on the name of the newly created Push Security provider.
3. Under **Download signing certificate** click the **Download** button. The contents of this certificate will be required in the next section.
4. Under **Metadata** click **Copy download URL**. This metadata URL will be required in the next section.

## Push Security configuration

1. Log in to the Push Security admin console.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Organization**.
3. Under **SAML configuration** click **Setup** and select **Custom SAML**.
4. Copy the displayed `Single Sign-On URL` and `Service Provider Entity URL`. They will be required in the next section.
5. TEMP
6. TEMP
7. TEMP

## Reconfigure authentik provider

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Providers** and click the **Edit** icon of the newly created Push Security provider.
3. Under **Protocol settgins**, set the following required configurations:
    - **ACS URL**: set the acs url to the copied `Single Sign-On URL` (e.g. https:).
    - **Audience**: set the audience to the copied `Service Provider Entity URL` (e.g. https:).
4. Click **Update**
