## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Calibre-Web with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair and a correspdonding group in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.

- **Choose a Provider type**: select LDAP Provider as the provider type.

- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name) and set the authorization flow to use for this provider.

- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

### Create a group in authentik

Create a group that will grant access to Calibre-Web.

1. Navigate to **Directory** > **Groups** and click **Create**.

- **Name**: provide a name (e.g. `Calibre-Web`).

2. Click **Create**.

### Add users to the group

Add the user that require access to the newly created group.

1. Navigate to **Directory** > **Groups** and click on the name of the group (e.g. `Calibre-Web`) that was just created.

2. Navigate to the **Users** tab and click **Add existing user**.

3. Click **+**.

4. Select the user that requires access and click **Add**.

5. Click **Add**.

## Calibre-Web configuration

1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Edit Basic Configuration** and click on **Feature Configuration** and set the following options:

- Login Type: `Use LDAP Authentication`
- LDAP Server: `<em>authentik.company</em>`
- LDAP Server Port: `389`
- LDAP Encryption: `None`
- LDAP Authentication: `Simple`
- LDAP Administrator Username: `cn=<em><authentik_administrator_username></em>,ou=users,dc=goauthentik,dc=io` (e.g. `cn=akadmin,ou=users,dc=goauthentik,dc=io`)
- LDAP Administrator Password: `<em><authentik_administrator_password></em>`
- LDAP Distinguished Name (DN): `dc=ldap,dc=goauthentik,dc=io`
- LDAP User Object Filter: `(&(objectclass=user)(cn=%s))`
- LDAP Server is OpenLDAP?: `true`
- LDAP Group Object Filter: `(&(objectclass=group)(cn=%s))`
- LDAP Group Name: `<em><group_name></em>` (e.g. `Calibre-Web`)
- LDAP Group Members Field: `member`
- LDAP Member User Filter Detection: `Autodetect`

2. Click **Save**.

3. Navigate to **Admin** and click **Import LDAP Users**

4. Once the user is imported from authentik, click **Edit Users** and give the user the desired permissions by checking the relevant checkboxes.

## Configuration verification

To confirm that authentik is properly configured with _Calibre-Web_, log out and log back in using the credentials of a user that is a member of the LDAP group (e.g. `Calibre-Web`).
