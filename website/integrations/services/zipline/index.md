## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Zipline with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively, you can create only an application, without a provider, by clicking **Create**.)

- **Application**: Provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
- **Choose a Provider type**: Select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: Provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), choose the authorization flow for this provider, and configure the following required settings:
    - Note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values because they will be required later.
    - Set a `Strict` redirect URI to <kbd>https://<em>zipline.company</em>/api/auth/oauth/oidc</kbd>.
    - Select any available signing key.
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: Create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## Zipline configuration

1. From the **Zipline administrative dashboard**, navigate to **Administrator** > **Settings**, then scroll down until you reach the **OAuth** section.

2. In the **OpenID Connect** subsection, configure the following values:

- **OIDC Client ID**: Your Client ID from authentik
- **OIDC Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from authentik
- **OIDC Authorize URL**: <kbd>https://<em>authentik.company</em>/application/o/authorize/</kbd>
- **OIDC Token URL**: <kbd>https://<em>authentik.company</em>/application/o/token/</kbd>
- **OIDC Userinfo URL**: <kbd>https://<em>authentik.company</em>/application/o/userinfo/</kbd>

3. Then, click **Save**.

## Configuration verification

To verify integration with authentik, log out of Zipline by clicking your user icon in the top right and selecting **Logout**. A new button should now appear on the login page, allowing you to sign in with authentik.
