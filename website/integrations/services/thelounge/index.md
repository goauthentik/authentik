:::note
This guide assumes you already deployed an LDAP Provider, if not check [here](https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/add-secure-apps/providers/ldap/generic_setup).
If you made any changes, e.g. using a different name for the user, make sure to apply them here as well.
:::

## Preparation

The following placeholders will be used:

- `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik install.
- `dc=company,dc=com` the Base DN of the LDAP outpost. If you followed the LDAP provider guide this is: `dc=goauthentik,dc=io`
- `ldap_bind_user` the username of the desired LDAP Bind User. If you followed the LDAP provider guide this is: `ldapservice`

## LDAP Configuration

### authentik Configuration

Follow the [instructions](https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/add-secure-apps/outposts/#create-and-configure-an-outpost) to create an LDAP outpost and configure access via the outpost. No additional authentik configuration needs to be configured.

### The Lounge configuration

In the `config.js` file find the `ldap` section and make the following changes:

1. Set `enable` to `true`
2. Set `url` to `ldap://authentik.company`
3. Set `primaryKey` to `cn`
4. In the `searchDN` section make the following changes:
    1. Set `rootDN` to `cn=ldap_bind_user,ou=users,dc=company,dc=com`
    2. Set `rootPassword` to the password you have given to the `ldap_bind_user`
    3. Set `filter` to `(&(objectClass=user)`
        1. Alternatively, if you want to restrict access by group, you can set it to: `(&(objectClass=user)(memberOf=cn=group_name,ou=groups,dc=ldap,dc=company,dc=com))`
    4. Set `base` to `dc=ldap,dc=company,dc=com`
5. Finally, save the `config.js` file and restart The Lounge. You should be able to log in via LDAP now, as long as a user with the same name exists.
