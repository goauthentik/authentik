## What is XCreds

> Xcreds is an open source project for synchronizing IdP passwords with macOS login passwords. Xcreds replaces the macOS login window to provide authentication to the cloud provider; a user enters their cloud password for authentication and Xcreds keeps the local Mac password synchronized with the cloud password.

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of XCreds with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)

    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    - Note the **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** values because they will be required later.
    - Set a `Strict` redirect URI to `https://127.0.0.1/xcreds`
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

### Copy OpenID configuration URL

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Providers** and click on the name of the newly created XCreds provider.
3. Copy the **OpenID Configuration URL**. This will be required to configure XCreds in the next section.

## XCreds configuration

Once XCreds is installed on a target Mac you will need to configure it by creating and installing and applying a profile. More information can be found in the [XCreds Admin Guide](https://twocanoes.com/knowledge-base/xcreds-admin-guide/)

### ProfileCreator

[ProfileCreator](https://github.com/ProfileCreator/ProfileCreator) is an Open Source MacOS application used to create configuration policies. It is required to create a configuration policy for XCreds.

1. Open the **ProfileCreator** application and click on the `+` icon in the top left corner to create a new configuration policy:

- Under **General**: provide a descriptive Payload Display Name, Payload Description, and Payload Organization.

2. Now you will need to add a XCreds payload to the configuration policy. Click on the **Application Managed Preferences** icon in the left hand column that looks like an `A` (Third icon from the left, in the left hand column).
3. Select XCreds in the list and click the **Add** button in the top right corner of the screen.
4. Under **Disabled Keys** click the `+` icon next to the following keys and set the required configurations:
    - **Client ID**: the authentik Client ID
    - **Client Secret**: the authentik Client Secret
    - **Discovery URL**: the authentik OpenID configuration URL
    - **Redirect URI**: `https://127.0.0.1/xcreds`
5. Click on the **Export Profile** icon at the top left of the screen and set the following required configurations:
    - **Platform**: `macOS`
    - **Scope**: `System`
    - **Payload Content Type**: `Profile`
6. Click **Save**.

### Install the profile to the target Mac

You will need to install the created profile on the target Mac.

1. Log into the Mac and navigate to **System Settings** > **General** > **Device Management**.
2. Under **Device**, click the `+` icon.
3. Select the profile that was created in the previous section.
4. Click **Continue**, **Install** and enter the device password.

## Configuration verification

To confirm that authentik is properly configured with XCreds on the target Mac, log out and log back in via the XCreds/authentik login screen.

If you need to log into a local account on the mac, you can click on the **Mac Login Window** button.
