Below is a list of all applications that are known to work with authentik. All app integrations will have one of these badges:

-   <span class="badge badge--secondary">Support level: Community</span> The
    integration is community maintained.

-   <span class="badge badge--info">Support level: Vendor</span> The integration
    is supported by the vendor.

-   <span class="badge badge--primary">Support level: authentik</span> The
    integration is regularly tested by the authentik team.

### Add a new application

To add documentation for a new application (with support level Community or Vendor), please use the integration template [`service.md`](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/blob/main/website/integrations/template/service.md) file from our GitHub repo. You can download the template file using the following command:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goauthentik/authentik/main/website/integrations/template/service.md
```

Don't forget to edit the `sidebarsIntegrations.js` file to add your new integration to the lefthand navigation bar.
