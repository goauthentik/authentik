# Applications

Most third-party services that support authentication protocols such as SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect can be integrated with authentik, allowing users to log in to these services using their authentik credentials.

If you don't see an application you're looking for, let us know. You can reach us on [GitHub](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik), [Discord](https://goauthentik.io/discord), or via email to [hello@goauthentik.io](mailto:hello@goauthentik.io). You can also add your own documentation for a new application integration following [these instructions](#add-a-new-application).

All documented app integrations will have one of these badges:

- <SupportBadge level="community" />: Community maintained.
- <SupportBadge level="vendor" />: Supported by the vendor.
- <SupportBadge level="authentik" />: Regularly tested by the authentik team.
- <SupportBadge level="deprecated" />: Deprecated and may be removed.

### Add a new application

<a id="add-new"></a>

To add documentation for a new application (with support level Community or Vendor), please use the integration template [`service.md`](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/blob/main/website/integrations/template/service.md) file from our GitHub repo. You can download the template file using the following command:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goauthentik/authentik/main/website/integrations/template/service.md
```

Don't forget to edit the `sidebarsIntegrations.js` file to add your new integration to the lefthand navigation bar.
