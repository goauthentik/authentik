Most third-party services that support authentication protocols such as SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect can be integrated with authentik, allowing users to log in to these services using their authentik credentials.

If you don't see an application you're looking for, let us know. You can reach us on [GitHub](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik), [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/809154715984199690/809154716507963434), or via email to [hello@goauthentik.io](mailto:hello@goauthentik.io).
