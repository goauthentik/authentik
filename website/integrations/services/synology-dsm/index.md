## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Synology DSM with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can create only an application, without a provider, by clicking **Create**.)

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
- **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    - Note the **Client ID**,**Client Secret**, and **slug** values because they will be required later.
    - Set a `Strict` redirect URI to <kbd>https://<em>synology.company</em>/#/signin</kbd>.
    - Select any available signing key.
    - Under **Advanced Protocol Settings**, set the **subject mode** to be based on the user's email.
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## Synology DSM configuration

To configure Synology DSM to utilize authentik as an OpenID Connect 1.0 Provider:

1. In the DSM Control Panel, navigate to **Domain/LDAP** -> **SSO Client**.
2. Check the **Enable OpenID Connect SSO service** checkbox in the **OpenID Connect SSO Service** section.
3. Configure the following values:

- Profile: OIDC
- Account type: Domain/LDAP/local
- Name: authentik
- Well Known URL: Copy this from the 'OpenID Configuration URL' in the authentik provider (URL ends with '/.well-known/openid-configuration')
- Application ID: The 'Client ID' from the authentik provider
- Application Key: The 'Client secret' from the authentik provider
- Redirect URL: https://synology.company/#/signin (This should match the 'Redirect URI' in authentik exactly)
- Authorization Scope: openid profile email
- Username Claim: preferred_username
- Save the settings.

## Troubleshooting

**Error `not privilege`**

The log in process could fail with a `not privilege` error, when the SSO pop-up is blocked. Allowing pop-ups in the browser configuration resolves this (see https://github.com/authelia/authelia/discussions/6902#discussioncomment-9756400).
