:::note
This guide focuses on ownCloud installations that are deployed using Docker. If you have deployed it using a different mechanism, there may be some differences in the process.
:::

## Preparation

The following placeholders will be used:

-   `owncloud.company` is the FQDN of the ownCloud install.
-   `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik install.

## Authentication

There are ownCloud plugins available that support various authentication methods, including:

-   [SAML/SSO](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/enterprise/user_management/user_auth_shibboleth.html)
-   [OAuth2](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/user_oauth2.html)
-   [OpenID Connect](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/oidc.html)

This guide will focus on OpenID Connect (OIDC).

### OpenID Connect (OIDC)

OIDC is supported in ownCloud through the use of the official [OIDC plugin](https://github.com/owncloud/openidconnect).

## authentik configuration

Ensure that you have a Signing Key available in authentik for use with these providers. Create one if necessary under **System > Certificates**.

Multiple provider/application pairs are required to support all ownCloud applications, one for each of the: Web UI, Desktop application, Android application and iOS application.
The configuration for each one is nearly identical, except that the Client ID and Client Secret are
[pre-defined](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/oidc.html#client-ids-secrets-and-redirect-uris) by ownCloud for the Desktop, Android, and iOS applications.
You are free to use the autogenerated Client ID and Secret for the Web UI (or any other appropriate ID/Secret pair).

Create an application and a provider with the following settings for each of the ownCloud applications you wish to support:

### Create a provider

In the authentik Admin Interface, go to **Applications -> Providers**. Create an **OAuth2/OpenID Provider** with the following parameters.
Parameters not listed here should be left as the default values, or can be customized per your preferences.

The following settings are common for the Web UI, and Desktop/Android/iOS applications:

-   General Settings:
    -   Name: owncloud (or owncloud-desktop, owncloud-android, etc.)
-   Protocol Settings:
    -   Signing Key: select the signing key you wish to use
-   Advanced Protocol Settings:
    -   Scopes: email, offline_access, openid, profile

The following settings are different for the different ownCloud applications:

-   Web UI
    -   Protocol Settings:
        -   Client ID: use generated authentik value (or customize if you wish)
        -   Client Secret: use generated authentik value (or customize if you wish)
        -   Redirect URIs: `https://owncloud.company/apps/openidconnect/redirect`
-   Desktop Application:
    -   Protocol Settings:
        -   Client ID: use the pre-defined values from [ownCloud](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/oidc.html#client-id)
        -   Client Secret: use the pre-defined values from [ownCloud](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/oidc.html#client-secret)
        -   Redirect URI:
            ```
            http://localhost:\d+
            http://127.0.0.1:\d+
            ```
-   Android Application:
    -   Protocol Settings:
        -   Client ID: use the pre-defined values from [ownCloud](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/oidc.html#client-id)
        -   Client Secret: use the pre-defined values from [ownCloud](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/oidc.html#client-secret)
        -   Redirect URI: `oc://android.owncloud.com`
-   iOS Application:
    -   Protocol Settings:
        -   Client ID: use the pre-defined values from [ownCloud](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/oidc.html#client-id)
        -   Client Secret: use the pre-defined values from [ownCloud](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/oidc.html#client-secret)
        -   Redirect URI: `oc://ios.owncloud.com`

##### Applications

#### ownCloud

In the authentik Admin Interface, go to **Applications -> Applications**, and create a new Application with the following settings for each of the providers defined above:

-   Name: owncloud, owncloud-desktop, owncloud-android, or owncloud-ios
-   Slug: same as name
-   Provider: one of the providers you created in the previous section
-   UI Settings:
    -   Launch URL: You can set this to `blank://blank` to prevent the application from being listed on the authentik
        home page. This may be useful for the desktop, android and ios applications, since you will not be able
        to navigate directly to those applications.
        :::note
        Sometimes this field glitches out when creating the application, you may need to save the application and then
        edit it to fill this field.
        :::

##### Service Discovery

In order for the ownCloud Applications to be able to login via OIDC, your reverse proxy will have to be configured to rewrite

`https://owncloud.company/.well-known/openid-configuration`

to

`https://owncloud.company/index.php/apps/openidconnect/config`

The ownCloud [documentation](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/oidc.html#set-up-service-discovery) includes an example for accomplishing this with Apache.

In Traefik, use the [replacepathregex](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/replacepathregex/) middleware to accomplish the same thing.
When using Traefik in docker-compose as your reverse proxy, add the following labels to your container. See examples in the docs linked above to accomplish this for other Traefik configurations.

```yaml
labels:
  ... # other labels for this service/router
  traefik.http.routers.owncloud.middlewares: owncloud-oidc-rewrite
  traefik.http.middlewares.owncloud-oidc-rewrite.replacepathregex.regex: ^/\.well-known/openid-configuration
  traefik.http.middlewares.owncloud-oidc-rewrite.replacepathregex.replacement: /index.php/apps/openidconnect/config
```

##### ownCloud OIDC Plugin

Navigate to the _Market_ in your ownCloud deployment by going to `https://owncloud.company/apps/market/#/` or by clicking the Hamburger menu in the top left of any page in your ownCloud deployment and then clicking _Market_.
From the Market, search for and enable the OIDC plugin

The OIDC plugin cannot be configured from the ownCloud UI, it must be done via the either the `config.php` file or by storing the configuration in the ownCloud database.
Depending on how your ownCloud deployment is set up, the `config.php` file might be exposed in different places.
The instructions below apply to deployments using Docker. Refer to the setup guide for your chosen deployment method to determine where the file is located within in your installation.

:::note
This guide will focus on configuration via the `config.php` mechanism.

Details on configuring the OIDC plugin using the ownCloud database are included in the OIDC plugin's [README](https://github.com/owncloud/openidconnect?tab=readme-ov-file#settings-in-database).
The configuration you end up with will be the same between the two methods, the only difference will be whether they end up in a `php` file or in the database (via an `occ` command).
:::

Create a file named `oidc.config.php` in the same directory as the existing `config.php` file in your ownCloud installation. ownCloud will treat files named with this pattern as "override" files, and will override matching configuration keys in the `config.php` file.

The specific location of this file will depend on your Docker configuration. The default location within the container is `/mnt/data/config` which, in the [official setup guide](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/next/admin_manual/installation/docker/#docker-compose), is exposed via the `files` volume.

Minimal contents of `oidc.config.php`:

```php
<?php
$CONFIG = [
  'http.cookie.samesite' => 'None',
  'openid-connect' => [
    'provider-url' => 'https://authentik.company/application/o/owncloud/', // replace `owncloud` with whatever name you selected for the web ui provider.
    'client-id' => <client id chosen in authentik provider configuration>,
    'client-secret' => <client secret chosen in authentik provider configuration>,
    'loginButtonName' => 'authentik Login', // this is the text that will be shown on the authentik login button. Choose whatever you want.
    'mode' => 'userid',
    'search-attribute' => 'preferred_username',
    ],
  ],
];
```

Enable automatic provisioning of new users by augmenting `openid-connect` key in the above configuration with the following options:

```php
  'openid-connect' => [
    ... // configuration keys from above
    'auto-provision' => [
      'enabled' => true,
      'email-claim' => 'email',
      'display-name-claim' => 'given_name',
      'update' => [
        'enabled' => true,
      ],
    ],
  ],
```

:::note
The above configuration will result in new ownCloud users having the same username as the authentik user they are created from.
If you would prefer to use the email address as the ownCloud username, simply remove the `mode` and `search-attributes` from the above configuration.

This doesn't really impact anything, though if you elect to use the email address as the ownCloud username, the mobile apps will show the user's username as `user@emailaddress.com@owncloud.company` in the menus, which is kind of strange.
:::

Some other notable configuration options:

```php
<?php
$CONFIG = [
  'token_auth_enforced' => true,  // desktop/android/ios clients will be forced to login with OIDC,
                                  // and existing sessions will be disconnected
  'openid-connect' => [
    'autoRedirectOnLoginPage' => true,  // automatic redirection to authentik sign-in
    ],
  ],
];
```

:::warning
If you enable the `autoRedirectOnLoginPage` configuration and your OIDC setup breaks, you will have no way of logging in.
If this happens, simply disable this setting and restart ownCloud to re-enable the standard login page.
:::

:::tip
The OIDC plugin's [README](https://github.com/owncloud/openidconnect?tab=readme-ov-file#settings-in-database) contains information about other configuration options.
:::

### Done!

You should now be able to login using OIDC through authentik. If you did not set the `autoRedirectOnLoginPage` option to `true`, when you navigate to `https://owncloud.company` you will be presented with a login page that now includes an "authentik Login" button (or whatever text you chose in the `loginButtonName` field). If you did set it to `true`, when you attempt to access `https://owncloud.company` you will automatically be redirected to the authentik login page.

New connections through any of the ownCloud applications (desktop, android, or ios) will automatically use OIDC for authentication.
If you wish to force existing sessions to re-authenticate using OIDC, simply set the `token_auth_enforced`
option to `true` in your `oidc.config.php` file (as mentioned in [OIDC section](#owncloud-oidc-plugin) above).
Users will then be forced to re-auth in their ownCloud clients.
