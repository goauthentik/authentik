## What is ownCloud

> ownCloud is a free and open-source software project for content collaboration and sharing and syncing of files.
>
> -- https://owncloud.com

## Preparation

The following placeholders are used in this guide:

- `owncloud.company` is the FQDN of the ownCloud installation.
- `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik installation.

:::info
This guide focuses on deploying ownCloud installations using Docker. If you deployed ownCloud using a different mechanism, there might be some differences in the process. Furthermore, these instructions use the [official OIDC plugin](https://github.com/owncloud/openidconnect). Advanced configuration details can be found in the [ownCloud admin manual](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/oidc.html).

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of ownCloud with authentik, you need to create multiple application/provider pairs in authentik. A different pair is required for the Web UI, Desktop application, Android application, and iOS application.

The configuration for each application is nearly identical, except for the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and the **Redirect URI** values, which are [predefined](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/oidc.html#client-ids-secrets-and-redirect-uris) by ownCloud for the Desktop, Android, and iOS applications.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can create only an application, without a provider, by clicking **Create**.) You will need to repeat the process four times: once each for the Desktop application, Web UI, Android application, and iOS application.

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
- **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.

    - Note the **Client ID**,**Client Secret**, and **slug** values because they will be required later.
    - **Protocol settings:**

        **Web UI:**

        - **Signing Key**: Select any available signing key.
        - **Client ID**: Use the value generated by authentik.
        - **Client Secret**: Use the value generated by authentik.
        - **Redirect URIs**:

            - Strict: <kbd>https://<em>owncloud.company</em>/apps/openidconnect/redirect</kbd>

        **Desktop Application**

        - **Signing Key**: Select any available signing key.
        - **Client ID**: Use the predefined value found in the [ownCloud admin manual](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/oidc.html#client-id).
        - **Client Secret**: Use the predefined value found in the [ownCloud admin manual](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/oidc.html#client-secret).
        - **Redirect URIs**:

            - Regex: <kbd>http://localhost:\d+</kbd>
            - Regex: <kbd>http://127.0.0.1:\d+</kbd>

        **Android Application**

        - **Signing Key**: Select any available signing key.
        - **Client ID**: Use the predefined value found in the [ownCloud admin manual](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/oidc.html#client-id).
        - **Client Secret**: Use the predefined value found in the [ownCloud admin manual](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/oidc.html#client-secret).
        - **Redirect URI**:

            - Strict: <kbd>oc://android.owncloud.com</kbd>

        **iOS Application**

        - **Signing Key**: Select any available signing key.
        - **Client ID**: Use the predefined value found in the [ownCloud admin manual](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/oidc.html#client-id).
        - **Client Secret**: Use the predefined value found in the [ownCloud admin manual](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/oidc.html#client-secret).
        - **Redirect URI**:

            - Strict: <kbd>oc://ios.owncloud.com</kbd>

    - **Advanced protocol settings:**
        - **Scopes**: Select the following scopes for each of the four application/provider pairs: `email`, `offline_access`, `openid`, `profile`.

- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

### Service discovery

To allow ownCloud applications to log in via OIDC, your reverse proxy must be configured to rewrite `https://owncloud.company/.well-known/openid-configuration` to `https://owncloud.company/index.php/apps/openidconnect/config`.

Refer to the [ownCloud Admin Manual](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration/user/oidc/oidc.html#set-up-service-discovery) for an example configuration using [Apache HTTPD](https://httpd.apache.org/).

For other reverse proxies, consult the provider-specific documentation for guidance on implementing this rewrite rule.

## ownCloud Configuration

To enable OIDC functionality in ownCloud, follow these steps:

1.  **Navigate to the Market**:

    - Access the Market by visiting:
      `https://owncloud.company/apps/market/#/`
      or by clicking the **Hamburger Menu** in the top-left corner of any page in your ownCloud deployment and selecting **Market**.
    - Search for and enable the **OIDC plugin**.

2.  **OIDC Plugin Configuration**:
    The OIDC plugin cannot be configured via the ownCloud UI. Configuration must be performed either:

        - by editing the `config.php` file
        OR
        - by storing the configuration in the ownCloud database

        The location of the `config.php` file depends on your deployment method. Consult the setup guide for your chosen deployment method to identify the fileâ€™s location within your installation.

        :::note

    Instructions for configuring the OIDC plugin using the ownCloud database can be found in the OIDC plugin's [README.md file](https://github.com/owncloud/openidconnect?tab=readme-ov-file#settings-in-database). Both methods produce identical configurations, differing only in whether the settings are stored in a `php` file or in the database (via an `occ` command).
    :::

3.  **Create the `oidc.config.php` File**:

    - Place a file named `oidc.config.php` in the same directory as the existing `config.php` file in your ownCloud installation.
    - Files named with this pattern are treated as "override" files, allowing ownCloud to override matching configuration keys in the `config.php` file.

    The location of this file depends on your Docker configuration. By default, the file resides in `/mnt/data/config` within the container. This location is exposed via the `files` volume in the [official setup guide](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/next/admin_manual/installation/docker/#docker-compose).

4.  **Minimal Contents of `oidc.config.php`**:
    Add the necessary configuration settings to this file. Ensure it includes at least the minimal requirements for your setup:

    :::warning
    You can configure ownCloud to use either the `sub` or `preferred_username` as the UID field under `search-attribute`. When using `preferred_username` as the user identifier, ensure that the [**Allow users to change username** setting](https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/sys-mgmt/settings#allow-users-to-change-username) is disabled to prevent authentication issues. The `sub` option uses a unique, stable identifier for the user, while `preferred_username` uses the username configured in authentik.
    :::

```php
<?php
$CONFIG = [
  'http.cookie.samesite' => 'None',
  'openid-connect' => [
    'provider-url' => 'https://authentik.company/application/o/owncloud/',
    'client-id' => '<Client ID from authentik>',
    'client-secret' => '<Client secret from authentik',
    'loginButtonName' => 'Log in with authentik',
    'mode' => 'userid',
    'search-attribute' => 'preferred_username',
    ],
  ],
];
```

To enable automatic provisioning of new users, you can augment the `openid-connect` configuration in your `oidc.config.php` file with the following settings:

```php
<?php
$CONFIG = [
  'http.cookie.samesite' => 'None',
  'openid-connect' => [
    'provider-url' => 'https://authentik.company/application/o/owncloud/',
    'client-id' => '<Client ID from authentik>',
    'client-secret' => '<Client secret from authentik>',
    'loginButtonName' => 'Log in with authentik',
    'mode' => 'userid',
    'search-attribute' => 'preferred_username',
    'auto-provision' => [
      'enabled' => true,
      'email-claim' => 'email',
      'display-name-claim' => 'given_name',
      'update' => [
        'enabled' => true,
      ],
    ],
  ],
];
```

:::note
The configuration above will result in new ownCloud users being assigned the same username as the authentik username. If you prefer to use the user's email address as the ownCloud username, you can remove the `mode` and `search-attribute` settings.

Note that using email as the username may cause mobile app interfaces to display usernames in an unusual format (e.g., `user@email.com@owncloud.company`).
:::

In addition to the above settings, here are some additional options for configuring the OIDC integration in ownCloud:

```php
<?php
$CONFIG = [
  'token_auth_enforced' => true,  // Forces OIDC authentication on all desktop, Android, and iOS clients, and disconnects existing sessions.
  'openid-connect' => [
    'autoRedirectOnLoginPage' => true,  // Enables automatic redirection to the authentik login page
  ],
];
```

:::warning
Enabling the `autoRedirectOnLoginPage` setting may lock you out of the system if your OIDC setup is misconfigured. To regain access, you can disable this setting and restart ownCloud, which will restore the standard login page.
:::

:::tip
For more information on other available configuration options, refer to the OIDC plugin's [README](https://github.com/owncloud/openidconnect?tab=readme-ov-file#settings-in-database).
:::

### You're done!

You have successfully configured OIDC authentication through authentik. Here's what you can expect next:

- **Login Behavior:**

    - If the `autoRedirectOnLoginPage` option is **set to false**, navigating to `https://owncloud.company` will present the standard login page, which now includes an "Log in with authentik" button (or any custom text defined in the `loginButtonName` field).
    - If the `autoRedirectOnLoginPage` option is **set to true**, users will be automatically redirected to the authentik login page when attempting to access `https://owncloud.company`.

- **ownCloud Applications:**
  Any new connections through the ownCloud desktop, Android, or iOS applications will automatically use OIDC for authentication.

- **Force Re-authentication:**
  To enforce re-authentication using OIDC for existing sessions, set the `token_auth_enforced` option to **true** in the `oidc.config.php` file (as detailed in the above section). This will prompt users to re-authenticate on their ownCloud clients.
