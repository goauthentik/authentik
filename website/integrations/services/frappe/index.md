- `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik installation.
- `provider` is the name for the social login provider in Frappe.

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Frappe with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can create only an application, without a provider, by clicking **Create**.)

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
- **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    - Note the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **slug** values because they will be required later.
    - Set a `Strict` redirect URI to <kbd>https://<em>frappe.company</em>/api/method/frappe.integrations.oauth2_logins.custom/provider</kbd>.
    - Select any available signing key.
    - Under **Advanced Protocol Settings**, set **Subject mode** to be `Based on the Users's username`.
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## Frappe configuration

1. From the Frappe main menu, navigate to **Integrations**, then to **Social Login Key**.
