This guide does _not_ cover Team Mapping. Please refer to EspoCRM's [documentation](https://docs.espocrm.com/administration/oidc/#team-mapping).

## Preparation

The following placeholders will be used:

- `crm.<your_company>` is the FQDN of the EspoCRM install.
- `authentik.<your_company>` is the FQDN of the authentik install.
- `_SLUG_` is the slug you choose upon application create in authentik.

## authentik configuration

1. Log into authentik as an admin, and navigate to **Applications** --> **Applications**.
2. Click **Create with Wizard**.

:::info
Alternatively, use our legacy process and click **Create**. The legacy process requires that the application and its configuration provider be configured separately.
:::

3. In the _New Application_ wizard, define the application details, and then define the provider details with the following parameters:

- **Provider Type**: `OAuth2/OIDC (Open Authorization/OpenID Connect)`

- **Authorization Flow**: `default-provider-authorization-explicit-consent (Authorize Application)`
- **Client Type**: `Confidential`
- **Redirect URIs/Origins**: `https://crm.<your_company>/oauth-callback.php`
- **Scopes**: OpenID, Email, Profile, Proxy outpost
- **Subject Mode**: `Based on the User's username` (**OR** your preferred method; you can use the same username in authentik and EspoCRM)
- **Signing Key**: Select any available key

Note the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` values.

## EspoCRM configuration

### Access the OIDC auth

1. Login to your admin user at `crm.<your_company>`.

2. In EspoCRM at Administration > Authentication, select the OIDC method. Below, on the same form, a OIDC panel will appear.

### Configure the OIDC auth

1. Configure the following variables:

- **Client ID**: enter the `Client ID` from authentik
- **Client Secret**: enter the `Client Secret` from authentik
- **Authorization Redirect URI**: `https://crm.<your_company>/oauth-callback.php`
- **Fallback Login**: _Select this option if you want EspoCRM's login as fallback._
- **Allow OIDC login for admin users**: _Select this option if you want EspoCRM's admin users to be able to log in via OIDC._

    _The following values are listed as slugs for clarity. An example for the first variable is included._

    You can also view the full URLs on the provider's page in authentik's Admin interface.

- **Authorization Endpoint**: `/application/o/authorize/`
    - (e.g. `https://crm.<your_company>/application/o/authorize/`)
- **Token Endpoint**: `/application/o/token/`
- **JSON Web Key Set Endpoint**: `/application/o/_SLUG_/jwks/`
- **Logout URL**: `application/o/_SLUG_/end-session/`

### Confirm the configuration

1. Select the `Save` option.

2. Access your EspoCRM instance (e.g. `crm.<your_company>`) in a private browser, and select `Sign In.`

- You will be presented with your authentik log-in screen.
