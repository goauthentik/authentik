## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Zammad with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings. Take note of the **slug** as it will be required later.
- **Choose a Provider type**: select **SAML Provider** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    - Set the **ACS URL** to <kbd>https://<em>zammad.company</em>/auth/saml/callback</kbd>.
    - Set the **Issuer** to <kbd>https://<em>zammad.company</em>/auth/saml/metadata</kbd>.
    - Set the **Audience** to <kbd>https://<em>zammad.company</em>/auth/saml/metadata</kbd>.
    - Set the **Service Provider Binding** to `Post`.
    - Under **Advanced protocol settings**, select an available signing certificate.
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

### Download certificate file

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Providers** and click on the name of the provider that you created in the previous section (e.g. `Provider for zammad`).
3. Under **Related objects** > **Download signing certificate **, click on **Download**. This downloaded file is your certificate file and it will be required in the next section.

## Zammad configuration

To configure the Zammad SAML options go to **Settings** (the gear icon) and select **Security** > **Third-party Applications**. Next, activate the **Authentication via SAML** toggle and change the following fields:

    - **Display name**: authentik
    - **IDP SSO target URL**: `https://authentik.company/application/saml/<application_slug>/sso/binding/post/`
    - **IDP single logout target URL**: `https://authentik.company/application/saml/<application_slug>/slo/binding/redirect/`

- **IDP Certificate**: paste the contents of your certificate file.
- **IDP certificate fingerprint**: Leave this empty.
- **Name Identifier Format**: `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress`
- **Automatic account link on initial logon**: Enable this to automatically create Zammad users when they sign in using authentik for the first time.
