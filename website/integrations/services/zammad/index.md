## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Zammad with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create property mappings

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Customization** > **Property Mappings** and click **Create**. Create two **SAML Provider Property Mapping**s with the following settings:
    - **Name Mapping:**
        - **Name**: Choose a descriptive name
        - **SAML Attribute Name**: <kbd>name</kbd>
        - **Friendly Name**: Leave blank
        - **Expression**: <kbd>return request.user.name</kbd>
    - **Email Mapping:**
        - **Name**: Choose a descriptive name
        - **SAML Attribute Name**: <kbd>email</kbd>
        - **Friendly Name**: Leave blank
        - **Expression**: <kbd>return request.user.email</kbd>

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can create only an application, without a provider, by clicking **Create**.)

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings. Take note of the **slug** as it will be required later.
- **Choose a Provider type**: select **SAML Provider** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    - Set the **ACS URL** to <kbd>https://<em>zammad.company</em>/auth/saml/callback</kbd>.
    - Set the **Issuer** to <kbd>https://<em>zammad.company</em>/auth/saml/metadata</kbd>.
    - Set the **Audience** to <kbd>https://<em>zammad.company</em>/auth/saml/metadata</kbd>.
    - Set the **Service Provider Binding** to `Post`.
    - Under **Advanced protocol settings**, add the two **Property Mappings** you created in the previous section, then set the **NameID Property Mapping** to the name property mapping created in the previous section.
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.
