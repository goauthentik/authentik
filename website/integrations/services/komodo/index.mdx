## What is Komodo

> Komodo is a web-based application designed to organize and streamline the management of servers, builds, deployments, and automated tasks.

## Preparation

The following placeholders are used in this guide:

- `komodo.company` is the FQDN of your Komodo installation.
- `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik installation.

:::note
This documentation lists only the settings that you need to change from their default values. Be aware that any changes other than those explicitly mentioned in this guide could cause issues accessing your application.

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Komodo with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)

    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
        - Note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values because they will be required later.
        - Set a `Strict` redirect URI to `https://komodo.company/auth/oidc/callback`.
        - Select any available signing key.
    - **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## Komodo configuration

### Setup OIDC connection

1. Edit the following environment variables in your Komodo `compose.env` file, or if using a mounted config file, edit your `./komodo/core.config.toml` file:

```yaml
KOMODO_OIDC_ENABLED=true
KOMODO_OIDC_PROVIDER=https://authentik.company/application/o/<application_slug>/
KOMODO_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=<authentik_client_ID>
KOMODO_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=<authentik client secret>
```

2. Redeploy Komodo for the changes to take effect.

### User configuration

Komodo doesn't currently have a method to provision OIDC users, therefore OIDC accounts need to be manually enabled after first login. Follow these steps to create and enable OIDC users in Komodo:

1. Log in to Komodo via the OIDC button on the login page.
2. You will be redirected to authentik to login (if you are already logged in, you will be redirected to step 3).
3. You will be redirected back to Komodo, and receive an error message saying "User Not Enabled".
4. Log in to Komodo using a local administrator account.
5. In the sidebar click **Settings**, and under the **Users** section, click the name of your authentik user. The **User type** should be **OIDC**.
6. Click **Enable User**, and assign the desired pemissions.

## Configuration verification

To ensure that authentik is correctly integrated with Komodo, log out and then log back in by clicking **OIDC**. You should be redirected to authentik to log in, and if the process is successful, you'll be taken to the Komodo dashboard.
