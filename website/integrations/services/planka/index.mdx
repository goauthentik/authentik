## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Planka with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)
    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
        - Note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values because they will be required later.
        - Set a `Strict` redirect URI to `https://planka.company/oidc-callback`.
        - Select any available signing key.
    - **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

### Create a group in authentik _(optional)_

To provision users in Planka with administrative permissions, you will need to create a group in authentik.

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Directory** > **Groups** and click **Create**.
3. Set a name for the group (e.g. `Planka Admins`) and click **Create**.
4. Click the name of the newly created group, and then switch to the **Users** tab.
5. Click **Add existing user**, select the user who requires Planka administrator access, and click **Add**.

## Planka configuration

Add the following required environment variables to your Planka deployment:

```yaml
OIDC_ISSUER=https://authentik.company/application/o/<application_slug>/
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=<client if from authentik>
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=<client secret from authentik>

#Optionally, if you want to provision users with administrator access, include the following environment variable:
OIDC_ADMIN_ROLES=<authentik group name>

#Optionally, if you want to enforce the use of SSO and disable local authentication, include the following environment variable:
OIDC_ENFORCED=true
```

## Configuration verification

To verify the integration with Planka, log out and attempt to log back in using the **Log in with SSO** button. You should be redirected to authentik. Once authenticated, you should then be redirected to the Planka dashboard.
