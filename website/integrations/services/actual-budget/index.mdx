> This guide explains how to configure Actual Budget to use authentik as the OAuth provider for logging in to the Web GUI.

## Preparation

The following placeholders are used in this guide:

- `actual.company` is the FQDN of the Actual Budget installation.
- `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik installation.

:::note
This documentation lists only the settings that you need to change from their default values. Be aware that any changes other than those explicitly mentioned in this guide could cause issues accessing your application.

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Actual Budget with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can create only an application, without a provider, by clicking **Create**.)

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
- **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    - Note the **Client ID**,**Client Secret**, and **slug** values because they will be required later.
    - Set a `Strict` redirect URI to <kbd>https://<em>actual.company</em>/openid/callback/</kbd>.
    - Select any available signing key. Actual Budget only supports the RS256 algorithm. Be aware of this when choosing a signing key.
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## Actual Budget configuration

1. Sign in to Actual Budget with a browser of your choice and access your budget by clicking on its name.

2. Click your budget in the top-left corner to open the dropdown menu and select **Settings**.

3. Scroll to the bottom and select **Show advanced settings**. Scroll again and select **I understand the risks, show experimental features**.

4. To enable the option **OpenID authentication method** select the checkbox next to it.

5. Scroll up to the new option **Authentication method...** and click **Start using OpenID**.

6. Set the following values from the authentik provider:
    - Set **OpenID Provider** to **authentik**
    - Set **OpenID provider URL** to https://_authentik.company_/application/o/_actual_/
    - Set **Client ID** to _client-id_
    - Set **Client secret** to _client-secret_

:::warning
The first user to log into Actual Budget via OpenID will become the owner and administrator with the highest privileges for the budget. For more information on how to create additional users, see the Note below.
:::

## Test the login

- Open a browser of your choice and navigate to https://_actual.company_.
- Select the OpenID login method in the dropdown menu and click **Sign in with OpenID**.
- You should be redirected to authentik (with the login flows you created), and then authentik will redirect you back to the https://_actual.company_ URL.
- If you are redirected back to the https://_actual.company_ URL and can see the budget file selection page, the setup was successful.

:::info
Users are not automatically created when logging in with authentik. The owner must manually create each user in Actual Budget. To do so, click **Server online** at the top next to your name and select **User Directory**. Add a new user. The `Username` must match the one in authentik. You can now grant the new user access to your budget by clicking **Server online** next to your name at the top and selecting **User Access**.
