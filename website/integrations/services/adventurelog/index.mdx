## Preparation

The following placeholders are used in this guide:

- `https://adventurelog.company` is the FQDN of the AdventureLog server installation.
- `https://authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik installation.

:::note
This documentation lists only the settings that you need to change from their default values. Be aware that any changes other than those explicitly mentioned in this guide could cause issues accessing your application.

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of AdventureLog with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
- **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    - Note the **Client ID**,**Client Secret**, and **slug** values because they will be required later.
    - Set a `Regex` redirect URI to <kbd>^https://<em>adventurelog.company</em>/accounts/oidc/.\*$</kbd>.
    - Select any available signing key.
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## AdventureLog configuration

:::info
`localhost` is unlikely to be a valid `server_url` because it refers to the server hosting AdventureLog, not authentik. Instead, use the IP address of the server running authentik or a domain name if available.
:::

1.  Log in to your AdventureLog installation as an administrator and launch the Admin Panel. To do so, click your **user avatar** in the navigation bar, select **Settings**, then click **Launch Admin Panel**. Alternatively, visit <kbd>https://<em>adventurelog.company</em>/admin</kbd>.
2.  Scroll down to **Social Accounts** and click **Add**. Fill in the following fields:

        - **Provider**: OpenID Connect
        - **Provider ID**: Enter the Client ID from authentik
        - **Name**: `authentik`
        - **Client ID**: Enter the Client ID from authentik
        - **Secret Key**: Enter the Client Secret from authentik
        - **Key**: Leave this line blank
        - Under **Settings**:
            - **server_url**: <kbd><em>https://authentik.company</em>/application/o/<em>your-application-slug</em>/</kbd>
            - **Sites**: move over the sites you want to enable authentik on, usually `example.com` and `www.example.com` unless you renamed your sites.

### Linking to Existing Account

If a user has an existing AdventureLog account and wants to link it to their authentik account, they can do so by logging in to their AdventureLog account and navigating to the **Settings** page. There is a button that says **Launch Account Connections**, click that and then choose the provider to link to the existing account.

## Troubleshooting

### 404 error when logging in.

Ensure the `https://adventurelog.company/accounts` path is routed to the backend, as it shouldn't hit the frontend when it's properly configured. For information on how to configure this, refer to the AdventureLog documentation on reverse proxy configuration [here](https://adventurelog.app/docs/install/getting_started.html).

### authentik - No Permission

Launch your authentik dashboard as an admin and find the AdventureLog app. Click **More details** then **Edit**. In the admin interface, click **Test** under **Check Access**. If you get a 403 error, you need to grant the user the correct permissions. This can be done by going to the user's profile and adding the correct permissions.

## Configuration verification

To confirm authentik is correctly integrated with AdventureLog, log out and attempt to log back in using OpenID Connect by clicking the **authentik** button on the AdventureLog login page.
