## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Homarr with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
- **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    - Note the **Client ID**,**Client Secret**, and **slug** values because they will be required later.
    - Create two `strict` redirect URIs and set to <kbd>https://homarr.company/api/auth/callback/oidc</kbd> and <kbd> http://localhost:50575/api/auth/callback/oidc</kbd>.
    - Select any available signing key.
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## Homarr configuration

Add the following environment variables to your Homarr configuration. Make sure to fill in the Client ID, Client Secret, OIDC Issuer, and OIDC URI from your authentik instance.

```sh
AUTH_PROVIDERS="oidc,credentials"
AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=<Client ID from authentik>
AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=<Client secret from authentik>
AUTH_OIDC_ISSUER=https://authentik.company/application/o/<slug from authentik>/
AUTH_OIDC_URI=https://authentik.company/application/o/authorize
AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_NAME=authentik
OAUTH_ALLOW_DANGEROUS_EMAIL_ACCOUNT_LINKING=true
# Optional: You can add this if you only want to allow auto login via authentik
# AUTH_OIDC_AUTO_LOGIN=true
```

Restart the Homarr service for the changes to take effect.
