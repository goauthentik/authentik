## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Stripe with authentik, you need to create a group, a property mapping, and an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create a user group in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Directory** > **Groups** and click **Create**.
3. Set a name for the group (e.g. `Stripe Admins`).
4. In the **Attributes** field enter: `stripe_role: admin`. Other account types are also supported, see the [Stripe SSO Documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/other#configuring-your-identity-provider)
5. Click **Create**.
6. Then, click the name of the newly created group and navigate to the **Users** tab.
7. Click **Add existing user**, select the user that needs Wazuh admin access and click **Add**.

### Create a property mapping in authentik

1.  Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2.  Navigate to **Customization** > **Property Mappings** and click **Create**. Then, create a **SAML Provider Property Mapping** using the following settings:

        - **Name**: `Stripe Role`
        - **SAML Attribute Name**: `Stripe-Role-acct-<stripe-account-id>`
        - **Friendly Name**: Leave blank
        - **Expression**:

        ```python
        return request.user.group_attributes().get("stripe_role", "")
        ```

    :::note
    To find your Stripe account ID, log in to your Stripe dashboard and navigate to **Settings** > **Account** > **Account details**. You'll find your account ID, which starts with `acct_`, displayed on the right-hand side.
    :::

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)

    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **SAML Provider** as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.

        - Set the **ACS URL** to `https://dashboard.stripe.com/login/saml/consume`.
        - Set the **Audience** to `https://dashboard.stripe.com/saml/metadata`.
        - Set the **Service Provider Binding** to `Post`.
        - Under **Advanced protocol settings**:
            - Set an available signing certificate.
            - Add the previously created `Stripe Role` property mapping to **Selected User Property Mappings**.
            - Set **NameID Property Mapping** to `authentik default SAML Mapping: Email`.

    - **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

### Download certificate file

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Providers** and click on the name of the provider that you created in the previous section (e.g. `Provider for Stripe`).
3. Under **Related objects** > **Download signing certificate**, click on **Download**. This downloaded file is your `Certificate` file and it will be required in the next section.

## Stripe configuration

1. Log in to the [Stripe administrator user authentication page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/user_authentication) as an administrator.
2. Click on the **Settings** cogwheel, and navigate to **Team and security** > **Single sign-on (SSO)**.
3. Click **Add domain**, then input the domain that SSO users will use. For more information, see the [Stripe Proving Domain Owenership documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/other#proving-domain-verification).
4. Once your domain is verified, click on the 3 dots next to the domain name, and click **Manage SSO Settings**.
5. Enter the following settings:

    - **Identity Provider URL**: `https://auth.domain.com/application/saml/stripe/sso/binding/redirect/`
    - **Issuer ID**: `authentik`
    - **Identity Provider Certificate**: Paste in the contents of your authentik signing certificate.

6. Click **Continue**.
7. Enter the email address of an authentik user designated for testing the SSO configuration and click **Continue**. Ensure that the user belongs to the appropriate authentik group. After logging in on authentik, you will be redirected back to Stripe.
8. If the test is successful, click **Continue**. Otherwise, verify your configuration and try again.
9. Choose the **SSO Enforcement** setting. Selecting `Required` mandates that users use authentik to log in, whereas `Optional` allows users to choose between authentik and the standard Stripe login.
10. Click **Save**.

## Configuration verification

To verify that authentik is properly integrated with Stripe, first sign out of your account. Then, navigate to the [Stripe dashboard login page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login) and then click **Sign in with SSO**. Enter an email address thatâ€™s provisioned for SSO, and click **Continue with SSO**. You will then be redirected to authentik for authentication before being sent back to the Stripe dashboard.
