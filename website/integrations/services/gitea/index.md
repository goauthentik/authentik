## Preparation

The following placeholders will be used:

-   `authentik.company` is the FQDN of authentik.
-   `gitea.company` is the FQDN of Gitea.

### Step 1

In authentik, create an _OAuth2/OpenID Provider_ (under _Resources/Providers_) with these settings:

:::note
Only settings that have been modified from default have been listed.
:::

**Protocol Settings**

-   Name: Gitea
-   Signing Key: Select any available key

:::note
Take note of the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, you'll need to give them to Gitea in _Step 3_.
:::

### Step 2

In authentik, create an application (under _Resources/Applications_) which uses this provider. Optionally apply access restrictions to the application using policy bindings.

:::note
Only settings that have been modified from default have been listed.
:::

-   Name: Gitea
-   Slug: gitea-slug
-   Provider: Gitea

### Step 3

Navigate to the _Authentication Sources_ page at https://gitea.company/admin/auths and click `Add Authentication Source`

Change the following fields

-   Authentication Name: authentik
-   OAuth2 Provider: OpenID Connect
-   Client ID (Key): Step 1
-   Client Secret: Step 1
-   Icon URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goauthentik/authentik/master/web/icons/icon.png
-   OpenID Connect Auto Discovery URL: https://authentik.company/application/o/gitea-slug/.well-known/openid-configuration
-   Additional Scopes: `email profile`

`Add Authentication Source` and you should be done. Your Gitea login page should now have a `Sign in With` followed by the authentik logo which you can click on to sign-in to Gitea with Authentik creds.
