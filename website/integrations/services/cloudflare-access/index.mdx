5. Set the authorization flow to **Authorize Application** (`default-provider-authorization-explicit-consent`).
6. Set the client type to **Confidential**.
7. Set the redirect URI to `https://mysubdomain.cloudflareaccess.company/cdn-cgi/access/callback`.
8. Ensure that the signing key is set to **Authentik Self-signed Certificate**.
9. Click **Finish** to create the provider.
