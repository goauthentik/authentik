## Preparation

The following placeholders are used in this guide:

- `komga.company` is the FQDN of the Komga install.
- `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik install.

## authentik configuration

1. From the **authentik Admin interface**, navigate to **Applications** -> **Applications**.
2. Use the wizard to create a new application and provider. During this process:
    - Note the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **slug** values because they will be required later.
    - Set the redirect URI to `https://komga.company/login/oauth2/code/authentik`.
    - Select any available signing key.

## Komga configuration

To configure Komga, update its `application.yml` file to include the following options:

:::info
All configuration options can be found in [Komga's OAuth2 Advanced configuration documentation](https://komga.org/docs/installation/oauth2/#advanced-configuration).
:::

:::warning
You can configure Komga to use either the `sub` or `preferred_username` as the UID field under `user-name-attribute`. When using `preferred_username` as the user identifier, ensure that the [**Allow users to change username** setting](https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/sys-mgmt/settings#allow-users-to-change-username) is disabled to prevent authentication issues. The `sub` option uses a unique, stable identifier for the user, while `preferred_username` uses the username configured in authentik.

```yml
spring:
    security:
        oauth2:
            client:
                registration:
                    authentik:
                        provider: authentik
                        client-id: <client id>
                        client-secret: <client secret>
                        client-name: authentik
                        scope: openid,email
                        authorization-grant-type: authorization_code
                        redirect-uri: "{baseUrl}/{action}/oauth2/code/{registrationId}"
                provider:
                    authentik:
                        user-name-attribute: preferred_username
                        issuer-uri: https://authentik.company/application/o/<application slug>/
