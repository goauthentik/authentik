## authentik configuration

To support the integration of FortiManager with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
- **Choose a Provider type**: select **SAML Provider** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    - Set the **ACS URL** to <kbd>https://<em>fortimanager.company</em>/saml/?acs</kbd>.
    - Set the **Issuer** to <kbd>https://<em>authentik.company</em>/application/saml/<em>application-slug</em>/sso/binding/redirect/</kbd>.
    - Set the **Service Provider Binding** to `Post`.
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## FortiManager Configuration

1. Navigate to <kbd>https://<em>fortimanager.company</em>/p/app/#!/sys/sso_settings</kbd> and select **SAML SSO Settings** to configure SAML.
2. Under **Single Sign-On Mode**, choose **Service Provider (SP)** to enable SAML authentication.
3. Set the **SP Address** field to the FortiManager FQDN, <kbd>fortimanager.company</kbd>. This provides the URLs needed for configuration in authentik.
4. Choose the **Default Login Page** as either **Normal** or **Single Sign-On**. Selecting **Normal** allows both local and SAML authentication, while **Single Sign-On** restricts login to SAML only.
5. By default, FortiManager creates a new user if one does not exist. Set the **Default Admin Profile** to assign the desired permissions to new users. A `no_permissions` profile is created by default for this purpose.
6. Set the **IdP Type** field to **Custom**.
7. For the **IdP Entity ID** field, enter: <kbd>https://<em>authentik.company</em>/application/saml/<em>application-slug</em>/sso/binding/redirect/</kbd>
8. Set the **IdP Login URL** to: <kbd>https://<em>authentik.company</em>/application/saml/<em>application-slug</em>/sso/binding/redirect/</kbd>
9. Set the **IdP Logout URL** to: <kbd>https://<em>authentik.company</em>/</kbd>
10. In the **IdP Certificate** field, import your authentik certificate (either self-signed or valid).
