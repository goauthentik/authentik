## Important information

This guide offers instructions for setting up authentik as a SAML provider specifically for Atlassian Cloud. It is applicable to all Atlassian Cloud applications, including Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, Trello, and others.

This guide does not provide instructions for SCIM user provisioning, which requires creating a custom Atlassian API integration and is beyond the scope of this document.

If this guide is implemented, users are still required to login to Atlassian Cloud using Atlassian credentials. Users are asked for authentik credentials when accessing specific Atlassian apps like Jira.

## Preparation

The following placeholders are used in this guide:

- `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik installation.

SAML SSO for Atlassian Cloud apps requires an [Atlassian Guard](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/understand-atlassian-guard/) subscription and a verified domain. Further information on requirements for SSO can be found in the [Atlassian SSO documentation](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/configure-saml-single-sign-on-with-an-identity-provider/).

:::note
This documentation lists only the settings that you need to change from their default values. Be aware that any changes other than those explicitly mentioned in this guide could cause issues accessing your application.

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Atlassian with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - Note the application slug, it will be required when filling out the **Identity provider SSO URL** later on.
- **Choose a Provider type**: select **SAML Provider** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    - Temporarily Set the **ACS URL** and **Issuer** to `https://temp.temp`
    - Set the **Service Provider Binding** to `Post`.
    - Under **Advanced protocol settings**, select an available signing certificate.
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

### Download the signing certificate

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Providers** and click on the name of the newly created Atlassian provider.
3. Under **Download signing certificate** click the **Download** button. The contents of this certificate will be required in the next section.

## Atlassian configuration

1. Log into the [Atlassian administrator portal](https://admin.atlassian.com) as an Atlassian organization admin.
2. Navigate to **Security** > **Identity providers**.
3. Under **Choose an identity provider** select **Other provider**.
4. Provide a **Directory name** e.g authentik and click **Add**.
5. Click **Set up SAML single sign-on** and then **Next**.
6. Set the following required configurations:
    - **Identity provider Entity ID**: `authentik`
    - **Identity provider SSO URL**: `https://authentik.company/application/saml/<application slug>/sso/binding/redirect/`
    - **Public x509 certificate**: enter the contents of the certificate that was downloaded in the previous section.
7. Click **Add**.
8. You will be shown a **Service provider entity URL** and **Service provider assertion consumer service URL**. Copy both, they will be required in authentik.
9. Click **Next**
10. Under **Link domain** select a verified domain.
11. Click **Stop and save SAML**

### Add URLs to authentik provider

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Providers** and click the **Edit** icon of the newly created Atlassian provider.
3. Under **Protocol settgins**, set the following required configurations:
    - **ACS URL**: set the acs url to the copied **Service provider assertion consumer service URL** (e.g. https://auth.atlassian.com/login/callback?connection=saml-example).
    - **Audience**: set the audience to the copied **Service provider entitty URL** (e.g. https://auth.atlassian.com/saml/example).
4. Click **Update**

### Enabling SSO

1. Login to admin.atlassian.com as an admin.
2. Navigate to **Security** > **External users**.
3. Click on **External user policy**.
4. Under **Authorization method** check **Single sign-on**.
5. Under **Identity provider** select `authentik`.
6. Click **Update**.

## Configuration verification

To verify that authentik is correctly integrated with Atlassian Cloud, first log out of your account. Then, log back in using your credentials for an external user.

At the dashboard, select an Atlassian app such as Jira. You will be asked to verify your identity and be redirected to your authentik instance. Enter your authentik credentials and are now logged into the selected Atlassian app.
