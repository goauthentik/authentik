The following placeholders are used in this guide:

- `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik installation.

SAML SSO for Atlassian products requires an [Atlassian Guard](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/understand-atlassian-guard/) subscription. Further information on Atlassian requirements can be found in the [Atlassian SSO documentation](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/configure-saml-single-sign-on-with-an-identity-provider/).

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Atlassian with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
- **Choose a Provider type**: select **SAML Provider** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    - _If there are any specific settings required, list them here. Refer to the [ownCloud integration documentation](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/blob/main/website/integrations/services/owncloud/index.md) for a complex requirements example._
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.
