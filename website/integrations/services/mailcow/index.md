## authentik configuration

To support the integration of mailcow with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
- **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    - Note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values because they will be required later.
    - Set a `Strict` redirect URI to <kbd>https://<em>mailcow.company</em></kbd>.
    - Select any available signing key.
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## mailcow configuration

To configure mailcow with authentik, log in as an administrator and navigate to **System** > **Configuration**.
Then, go to **Access** > **Identity Provider** and enter the following information in the form:

- **Identity Provider**: <kbd>Generic-OIDC</kbd>
- **Authorization endpoint**: <kbd>https://<em>authentik.company</em>/application/o/authorize/</kbd>
- **Token endpoint**: <kbd>https://<em>authentik.company</em>/application/o/token/</kbd>
- **User info endpoint**: <kbd>https://<em>authentik.company</em>/application/o/userinfo/</kbd>
- **Client ID**: The `Client ID` from the authentik provider
- **Client Secret**: The `Client secret` from the authentik provider
- **Redirect Url**: <kbd>https://<em>mailcow.company</em></kbd>
- **Client Scopes**: <kbd>openid profile email</kbd>

## Configuration verification

To confirm that authentik is properly configured with mailcow, log out and log back in via authentik.
