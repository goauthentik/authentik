## What is Jenkins

> The leading open source automation server, Jenkins provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.

## Preparation

The following placeholders will be used:

-   `jenkins.company` is the FQDN of the Service install.
-   `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik install.

Create an OAuth2/OpenID provider with the following parameters:

-   **Client Type**: `Confidential`
-   **Scopes**: OpenID, Email and Profile
-   **Signing Key**: Select any available key

Note the Client ID and Client Secret values for the provider.

Next, create an application, using the provider you've created above. Note the slug of the application you create.

## Jenkins Configuration

Navigate to the Jenkins plugin manager: **Manage Jenkins** -> **Plugins** -> **Available plugins**. Search for the plugin `oic-auth` in the search field, and install the plugin. Jenkins must be restarted afterwards to ensure the plugin is loaded.

After the restart, navigate to **Manage Jenkins** again, and click **Security**.

Modify the **Security Realm** option to select `Login with Openid Connect`.

In the **Client id** and **Client secret** fields, enter the Client ID and Client Secret values from the provider you created.

Set the configuration mode to **Automatic configuration** and set the **Well-known configuration endpoint** to `https://authentik.company/application/o/<Slug of the application from above>/.well-known/openid-configuration`

Check the checkbox **Override scopes** and input the scopes `openid profile email` into the new input field.

Further down the page, expand the **Advanced** section and input the following values:

-   **User name field name**: `preferred_username`
-   **Full name field name**: `name`
-   **Email field name**: `email`
-   **Groups field name**: `groups`

We also recommend enabling the option **Enable Proof Key for Code Exchange** further down the page.

Additionally, as a fallback to regain access to Jenkins in the case of misconfiguration, we recommend configuring the **Configure 'escape hatch' for when the OpenID Provider is unavailable** option below. How to configure this option is beyond the scope of this document, and is explained by the OpenID Plugin.
