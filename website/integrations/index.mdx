## What is an integration?

An integration is a how authentik connects to third-party applications, directories, and other identity providers.
Integrations are categorized into two categories: **Applications** and **Sources**.

### Applications

Applications include vendor tools such as Google Workspace, GitHub, Slack, or AWS. These applications can be integrated with authentik to provide single sign-on capabilities to securely authenticate users.

If you want to integrate an application that isn't listed, authentik can be configured to work with most applications that support authentication protocols such as [SAML](../docs/add-secure-apps/providers/saml/index.md), [OAuth and OpenID Connect](../docs/add-secure-apps/providers/oauth2/index.mdx).

To learn more, refer to the [Applications](../integrations/services/index.mdx) page.

### Federated and social sources

Sources are a way for authentik to use external user credentials for authentication. Supported integrations with external sources via authentik include federated directories like Active Directory and social logins such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. These integrations support all major protocols, including [LDAP](../docs/users-sources/sources/protocols/ldap/index.md), [SCIM](../docs/users-sources/sources/protocols/scim/index.md), [SAML](../docs/users-sources/sources/protocols/saml/index.md), and [OAuth and OpenID Connect](../docs/users-sources/sources/protocols/oauth/index.mdx)
