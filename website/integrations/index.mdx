## Sources

In addition to applications, authentik also integrates with external sources, including federated directories like Active Directory and through protocols such as LDAP, OAuth, SAML, and SCIM sources. Sources are a way for authentik to use external credentials for authentication and verification. Sources in authentik can also be used for social logins, using external providers such as Facebook, Twitter, etc.

To learn more, refer to the [Sources](../docs/sources) documentation.
