## What is an integration?

An integration is a how authentik connects to third-party applications, directories, and other identity providers.
Integrations are categorized into two categories: **Applications** and **Sources**.

### Applications

Applications include vendor tools such as Google Workspace, GitHub, Slack, or AWS. These applications can be integrated with authentik to provide single sign-on capabilities to

If you're looking to integrate an application that isn't listed, authentik can be configured to work with most applications that support authentication protocols such as [SAML](../docs/add-secure-apps/providers/saml/index.md), [OAuth and OpenID Connect](../docs/add-secure-apps/providers/oauth2/index.mdx).

To learn more, refer to the [Applications](../integrations/services/index.mdx) page.

### Federated and social sources

Sources are a way for authentik to use external credentials for authentication, authentik also integrates with external sources, including federated directories like Active Directory and through protocols such as [LDAP](../docs/users-sources/sources/protocols/ldap/index.md), [SCIM](../docs/users-sources/sources/protocols/scim/index.md), [SAML](../docs/users-sources/sources/protocols/saml/index.md), and [OAuth and OpenID Connect](../docs/users-sources/sources/protocols/oauth/index.mdx)

Sources in authentik can also be used for social logins, using external providers such as Facebook, Twitter, etc.
