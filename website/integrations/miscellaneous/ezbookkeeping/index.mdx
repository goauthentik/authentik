## Preparation

The following placeholders are used in this guide:

- `ezbookkeeping.company` is the FQDN of the ezBookkeeping installation.
- `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik installation.

:::info
This documentation lists only the settings that you need to change from their default values. Be aware that any changes other than those explicitly mentioned in this guide could cause issues accessing your application.

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of ezBookkeeping with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)
    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
        - Note the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **slug** values because they will be required later.
        - Set a `Strict` redirect URI to `https://ezbookkeeping.company/oauth2/callback`.
        - Select any available signing key.
    - **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## ezBookkeeping configuration

You can configure ezBookkeeping through environment variables or by editing its INI file:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="env"
  values={[
    { label: 'Environment Variables', value: 'env' },
    { label: 'INI file', value: 'ini' },
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="env">
Set the following environment variables to enable OpenID Connect authentication:

```yaml showLineNumbers
EBK_SERVER_DOMAIN=ezbookkeeping.company
EBK_SERVER_ROOT_URL=https://ezbookkeeping.company/
EBK_AUTH_ENABLE_OAUTH2_AUTH=true
EBK_AUTH_OAUTH2_PROVIDER=oidc
EBK_AUTH_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=<client_id>
EBK_AUTH_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret>
EBK_AUTH_OIDC_PROVIDER_BASE_URL=https://authentik.company/application/o/<application_slug>/
EBK_AUTH_ENABLE_OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME=true
EBK_AUTH_OIDC_CUSTOM_DISPLAY_NAME=authentik
```

Restart ezBookkeeping for the changes to take effect.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ini">
Set the following variables in the ezBookkeeping configuration file to enable OpenID Connect authentication:

```ini showLineNumbers title="/conf/ezbookkeeping.ini"
[server]
domain = ezbookkeeping.company
root_url = https://ezbookkeeping.company/

[auth]
enable_oauth2_auth = true
oauth2_provider = oidc
oauth2_client_id = <client_id>
oauth2_client_secret = <client_secret>
oidc_provider_base_url = https://authentik.company/application/o/<application_slug>/
enable_oidc_display_name = true
oidc_custom_display_name = authentik
```

Restart ezBookkeeping for the changes to take effect.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note Linking existing accounts
If you're already signed in, go to **User Settings** > **Security** and click **Link** under **Third-Party Logins** to connect your authentik account.
:::

## Configuration verification

To confirm that authentik is properly configured with ezBookkeeping, log out of ezBookkeeping, click **Log in with authentik**, and complete the authentik sign-in flow. A successful authentication should return you to ezBookkeeping with access to your account.
