## Preparation

The following placeholders are used in this guide:

-   `https://wallos.company` is the FQDN of the Wallos installation.
-   `https://authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik installation.

This documentation lists only the settings that you need to change from their default values. Be aware that any changes other than those explicitly mentioned in this guide could cause issues accessing your application.

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Wallos with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair in authentik. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)

-   **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
-   **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
-   **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    -   Note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values because they will be required later.
    -   Set a `Strict` redirect URI to `https://wallos.company/index.php`.
    -   Select any available signing key.
-   **Configure Bindings** (optional): you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## Wallos configuration

This configuration is done in the Wallos Admin Panel.

1. Log in to your Wallos installation as an administrator and open the Admin Panel.
2. Scroll to the **OIDC settings** section and enable OIDC/OAuth.
3. Fill in the fields below.

### Wallos OIDC fields

Set the following values in Wallos:

-   **Provider Name**: `authentik`
-   **Client ID**: Enter the Client ID from authentik
-   **Client Secret**: Enter the Client Secret from authentik
-   **Authorization URL**: `https://authentik.company/application/o/authorize/`
-   **Token URL**: `https://authentik.company/application/o/token/`
-   **User Info URL**: `https://authentik.company/application/o/userinfo/`
-   **Redirect URL**: `https://wallos.company/index.php`
-   **User Identifier Field**: `sub`
-   **Scopes**: `openid email profile`

## Configuration verification

To confirm authentik is correctly integrated with Wallos, log out and attempt to log back in using OIDC/OAuth. You should be redirected to authentik, and after successful authentication, back to Wallos.
