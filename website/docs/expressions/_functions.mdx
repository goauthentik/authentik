### `regex_match(value: Any, regex: str) -> bool`

Check if `value` matches Regular Expression `regex`.

Example:

```python
return regex_match(request.user.username, '.*admin.*')
```

### `regex_replace(value: Any, regex: str, repl: str) -> str`

Replace anything matching `regex` within `value` with `repl` and return it.

Example:

```python
user_email_local = regex_replace(request.user.email, '(.+)@.+', '')
```

### `list_flatten(value: list[Any] | Any) -> Optional[Any]`

Flatten a list by either returning its first element, None if the list is empty, or the passed in object if its not a list.

Example:

```python
user = list_flatten(["foo"])
# user = "foo"
```

### `ak_call_policy(name: str, **kwargs) -> PolicyResult`

Call another policy with the name _name_. Current request is passed to policy. Key-word arguments
can be used to modify the request's context.

Example:

```python
result = ak_call_policy("test-policy")
# result is a PolicyResult object, so you can access `.passing` and `.messages`.
# Starting with authentik 2023.4 you can also access `.raw_result`, which is the raw value returned from the called policy
# `result.passing` will always be a boolean if the policy is passing or not.
return result.passing

result = ak_call_policy("test-policy-2", foo="bar")
# Inside the `test-policy-2` you can then use `request.context["foo"]`
return result.passing
```

### `ak_is_group_member(user: User, **group_filters) -> bool`

Check if `user` is member of a group matching `**group_filters`.

Example:

```python
return ak_is_group_member(request.user, name="test_group")
```

### `ak_user_by(**filters) -> Optional[User]`

Fetch a user matching `**filters`.

Returns "None" if no user was found, otherwise returns the [User](../users-sources/user/index.mdx) object.

Example:

```python
other_user = ak_user_by(username="other_user")
```

### `ak_user_has_authenticator(user: User, device_type: Optional[str] = None) -> bool`

Check if a user has any authenticator devices. Only fully validated devices are counted.

Optionally, you can filter a specific device type. The following options are valid:

- `totp`
- `duo`
- `static`
- `webauthn`

Example:

```python
return ak_user_has_authenticator(request.user)
```

### `ak_create_event(action: str, **kwargs) -> None`

Create a new event with the action set to `action`. Any additional key-word parameters will be saved in the event context. Additionally, `context` will be set to the context in which this function is called.

Before saving, any data-structure which are not representable in JSON are flattened, and credentials are removed.

The event is saved automatically

Example:

```python
ak_create_event("my_custom_event", foo=request.user)
```

### `ak_create_jwt(user: User, provider: OAuth2Provider | str, scopes: list[str], validity = "seconds=60") -> str | None`:ak-version[2025.2]

Create a new JWT signed by the given `provider` for `user`.

The `provider` parameter can either be an instance of `OAuth2Provider` or a the name of a provider instance as a string. Scopes is an array of all scopes that the JWT should have.

The JWT is valid for 60 seconds by default, this can be customized using the `validity` parameter. The syntax of the parameter is `hours=1,minutes=2,seconds=3`. The following keys are allowed:

    - Microseconds
    - Milliseconds
    - Seconds
    - Minutes
    - Hours
    - Days
    - Weeks

    All values accept floating-point values.

Example:

```python
jwt = ak_create_jwt(request.user, "my-oauth2-provider-name", ["openid", "profile", "email"])
```

### `ak_send_email(address: str | list[str], subject: str, body: str = None, stage: EmailStage = None, template: str = None, context: dict = None) -> bool`:ak-version[2025.10]

Send an email using authentik's email system.

The `address` parameter specifies the recipient email address(es). It can be:

- A single email address as a string: `"user@example.com"`
- A list of email addresses: `["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com"]`

:::note
When using multiple recipients, all email addresses will be visible in the "To:" field of the email. If you need to send to multiple recipients without revealing all addresses to each other, send individual emails instead.
:::

The `subject` parameter sets the email subject line.

You must provide either `body` (for plain text/HTML content) or `template` (for template rendering), but not both.

The `stage` parameter can be an `EmailStage` instance for custom email settings. If `None`, global email settings are used.

The `template` parameter specifies a template name to render. When using templates, you can pass additional context variables via the `context` parameter.

If the email is queued successfully, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Examples:

```python
# Send email with plain body to single recipient
ak_send_email("user@example.com", "Welcome!", body="Welcome to our platform!")

# Send email to multiple recipients
ak_send_email(
    ["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com", "admin@example.com"],
    "System Maintenance",
    body="Scheduled maintenance will occur tonight."
)

# Send email using a template
ak_send_email("user@example.com", "Password Reset", template="email/password_reset.html")

# Send email with custom context for template to multiple recipients
ak_send_email(
    ["user@example.com", "admin@example.com"],
    "Account Update",
    template="email/event_notification.html",
    context={
        "title": "Profile Updated",
        "body": "Your account profile has been successfully updated.",
        "key_value": {"Updated Field": "Email Address", "Date": "2025-01-01"}
    }
)

# Send email with custom email stage
ak_send_email("admin@example.com", "Report", body="Daily report", stage=my_custom_stage)
```

## Comparing IP Addresses

To compare IP Addresses or check if an IP Address is within a given subnet, you can use the functions `ip_address('192.0.2.1')` and `ip_network('192.0.2.0/24')`. With these objects you can do [arithmetic operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#operators).

You can also check if an IP Address is within a subnet by writing the following:

```python
ip_address('192.0.2.1') in ip_network('192.0.2.0/24')
# evaluates to True
```

## DNS resolution and reverse DNS lookups

To resolve a hostname to a list of IP addresses, use the functions `resolve_dns(hostname)` and `resolve_dns(hostname, ip_version)`.

```python
resolve_dns("google.com")  # return a list of all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
resolve_dns("google.com", 4)  # return a list of only IP4 addresses
resolve_dns("google.com", 6)  # return a list of only IP6 addresses
```

You can also do reverse DNS lookups.

:::note
Reverse DNS lookups may not return the expected host if the IP address is part of a shared hosting environment.
See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/19867936
:::

To perform a reverse DNS lookup use `reverse_dns("192.0.2.0")`. If no DNS records are found the original IP address is returned.

:::info
DNS resolving results are cached in memory. The last 32 unique queries are cached for up to 3 minutes.
