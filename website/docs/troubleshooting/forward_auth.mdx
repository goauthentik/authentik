## Set the log level to `trace`

Setting the log level to trace configures the outpost to trace-log all the headers given in forward auth requests.

This is helpful to confirm that certain required Headers are correctly forwarded from the reverse proxy.

### When using the embedded outpost

When using the [embedded outpost](../add-secure-apps/outposts/embedded/embedded.mdx), the logs output identically to all other authenik logs. Refer to the [Capturing authentik logs](./logs/logs.mdx) documentation for instructions on how to enable `trace` logging.

### When using a standalone outpost

When using a standalone outpost, the logs output to that specific container. Refer to the [Capturing outpost logs](./logs/outpost_logs.mdx) documentation for instructions on how to enable `trace` logging.

## Ensure `/outpost.goauthentik.io` is accessible

Everything under `/outpost.goauthentik.io` should be publicly accessible, as URLs under this path are used for authentication.

To check this, run `curl -v https://app.company/outpost.goauthentik.io/ping`. A correct setup should return a `HTTP/2 204` status code.
