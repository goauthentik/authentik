Forward-auth errors typically occur when the reverse proxy drops required headers or blocks authentik helper endpoints. The result is a login loop, unexpected status codes, or other unexpected behavior.

## Capture header details with trace logging

Temporarily raise the log level to `trace` so the outpost records every header it receives. Follow the platform-specific steps in the [Logs troubleshooting guide](../administration/logs.mdx#enabling-trace-mode) to enable trace mode.

After turning on trace logging, reproduce the failing request and inspect the outpost logs (for example, `docker compose logs --tail=200 outpost`). Verify that headers such as `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and `X-Forwarded-For` appear with the expected values.

:::caution
Trace logging is verbose. Use the same guide to revert the log level to `info` once you finish troubleshooting.

## Verify outpost endpoints are reachable

The reverse proxy must expose the outpost helper paths. Confirm that `/outpost.goauthentik.io/` responds with a `204` status:

```shell
curl -v https://app.company/outpost.goauthentik.io/ping
```

A working setup returns output similar to:

```
< HTTP/2 204
```
