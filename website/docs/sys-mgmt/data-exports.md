authentik enterprise allows you to export User and Event data in CSV format for backup or analysis purposes.
For detailed instructions on exporting users and events, see [Export users](../users-sources/user/user_basic_operations.md#export-users-) and [Export events](events/logging-events.md#export-events-) respectively.

You can access past data exports from the **System Management** > **Data Exports** page. On this page you can view the query used for a specific export,
search exports by data type and user, download completed exports and delete exports that you no longer need.
