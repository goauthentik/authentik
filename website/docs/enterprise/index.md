title: Welcome to authentik Enterprise
---

The Enterprise release of authentik provides all of the functionality that we have spent years building in our open source product, with a full support plan and an expanded feature set.

Enterprise licenses can be purchased via our [Customer Portal](https://customers.goauthentik.io/). Alernatively, if you'd like to organize a call with our team to discuss your needs, contact us via hello@goauthentik.io.

Refer to our Enterprise documentation for further information:

- [Get started with Enterprise](./get-started.md)
- [Using the customer portal](./manage-enterprise.mdx)
- [Accessing Enterprise support](./enterprise-support.md)

Our standard technical documentation covers how to configure, customize, and use authentik, whether the open source version that we have built our reputation on or our Enterprise version with dedicated support.
