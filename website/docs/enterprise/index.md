title: Welcome to authentik Enterprise
---

The Enterprise release of authentik provides all of the functionality that we have spent years building in our open source product, with a full support plan and an expanded feature set.

Refer to our Enterprise documentation for information about creating and managing your organization, purchasing and activating a license, support, and managing billing and organization members.

-   [Get started with Enterprise](./get-started.md)
-   [Manage your Enterprise account](./manage-enterprise.md)
-   [Support for Enterprise accounts](./entsupport.md)

Our standard technical documentation covers how to configure, customize, and use authentik, whether the open source version that we have built our reputation on, or our Enterprise version with dedicated support.
