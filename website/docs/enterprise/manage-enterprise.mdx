The authentik [Customer Portal](https://customers.goauthentik.io/) allows you to purchase Enterprise licenses, control which users are able to access your licenses, and manage your billing information.

## Organization management

Your organization defines users, their roles, and billing information (including payments and invoices).

### Create an Organization

1. To create a new organization, log in to the [Customer Portal](https://customers.goauthentik.io/).
2. On the **My organizations** page, click **Create an organization**.
3. Specify the organization's name and notification email address, and then click **Create**.

:::info Deleting an organization
If you need to delete an organization, contact us via hello@goauthentik.io.
:::

### Add/remove users of an organization

In the Customer Portal, you can invite new users to your organization and remove existing ones. Users can have either of the following roles:

- **Member**: can view licenses, including the license key.
- **Owner**: can do everything the Member role can do, plus: add and remove members, order and renew licenses, and edit the organization.

1. To manage membership in an organization, log in to the [Customer Portal](https://customers.goauthentik.io/).
2. On the **My organizations** page, click the name of the organization whose membership you want to edit.
    - To remove a member, scroll down to the **Membership** area and then click **Remove** beside the name of the member.

    - To invite a new member, scroll down to the **Pending invitations** area, enter the email address for the new member, select their role, and then click **Invite**.

    A message appears that the invitation has been sent. When the recipient accepts the invitation by clicking a link in the email, they will be added to the organization.

## License management

Authentik licenses are linked to a specific authentik deployment based on its Installation ID. You can obtain your Installation ID by first logging in to the Admin interface of your authentik deployment. Then, navigate to **Enterprise** > **Licenses** where your installation ID is displayed.

A license covers a specified number of users, however additional users can be added to a license. Alternatively, additional licenses can be purchased for the same deployment.

### Purchase a license

[Learn more](#about-users-and-licenses) about **internal** and **external** users, and how we forecast the number of users.
:::

1. To purchase a license, log in to the [Customer Portal](https://customers.goauthentik.io/). If you have not already created an Organization (nor been invited to join one), you are first prompted to [create an organization](#create-an-organization).
2. Select the Organization you wish to purchase a license for.
3. Click **Purchase license**.
4. Select the number of Internal and External users that the license should cover.
5. Provide the **Installation ID** of your authentik deployment. This is available in the **Enterprise** > **License** section of the Admin interface.
6. Optionally, change the license name. This is how the license is identififed in the customer portal and Admin interface.
7. Click **Continue** to display the checkout page. Provide your payment details and click **Pay and subscribe**.

When payment verification is complete, you are redirected to the **My organizations** page, where you should see a message saying "Successful purchase. Your license will appear here once we've validated your payment. If it doesn't, please contact us."

When ready, the license displays on the organization's page.

8. To retrieve your license key, click on **Details** beside the license name and copy the key.

### Install a license

1. Log in to the authentik Admin interface as an administrator.
2. Navigate to **Enterprise** > **Licenses**.
3. Click **Install**, paste the license key, and then click **Install**.
   The license, its user limit, and expiry date are then displayed.

### Update your license

If you purchase a new license, or receive a new one due to a change in the number of users, you will need to remove the old license and add the new one. To do so, log in to the Admin interface, navigate to **Enterprise** > **Licenses**, click on **Install**, paste the new key, and then click **Install**.

## About users and licenses

License usage is calculated based on total user counts that authentik regularly captures. This data is checked against all valid licenses, and the sum total of all users.

:::info
Accounts that are disabled, as well as service accounts, are excluded from the license user count.
:::

### Internal vs external users

An **internal** user is typically a team member, such as a company employee, who is granted access to the full Enterprise feature set. This includes the ability to view and use the **My Applications** and **User Settings** pages.

An **external** user might be an external consultant, a volunteer in a charitable site, or a B2C customer. External users can't access the **My Applications** and **User Settings** pages. Instead, external users are typically authenticated and then redirected to log directly into their [default application](../sys-mgmt/brands/index.md#external-user-settings).

### License violation notifications

The following events occur when a license expires or the internal/external user count is over the licensed user count:

    - After 2 weeks administrators see a warning banner in the Admin interface
    - After another 2 weeks, all users see a warning banner
    - After another 2 weeks, the authentik Enterprise instance becomes "read-only"

    When an authentik instance is in read-only mode, the following actions are still possible:

    - Users can authenticate and authorize applications
    - Licenses can be modified
    - Users can be modified/deleted

    After the violation is corrected (license is renewed or user count is lowered), authentik will return to the standard read-write mode and the notification will disappear.

### How to increase user counts

There are two ways to increase your user counts.

1. Purchase an additional license and install it on the authentik deployment, in which case the total user count of all your licenses is the maximum number of users. However, this means that your licensing renewals will not happen at the same date.

2. The second way is to [open a support ticket](./enterprise-support.md) with us and we'll upgrade the number of users in your license. You'll be charged the prorated amount for the remaining time until the next license renewal.

## Manage Billing

Billing is based on each individual organization.

1. To manage your billing, log in to the [Customer Portal](https://customers.goauthentik.io) and navigate to **Organizations** > **My organizations**.
2. Select the organization for which you want to manage billing.
3. Click **Manage Billing** in the top left of the page.

    On the billing page you can:
    - update your account information (address, name, phone number, and tax ID)
    - add a payment method
    - view your invoice and payment history
    - cancel your subscriptions

### Cancel your subscription

To cancel your subscription, access the [billing management interface](#manage-billing), choose the subscription to cancel, and click **Cancel subscription**.

Once a subscription is canceled, the associated license will be valid until the end of the billing period, but it will not be automatically renewed.
