Installing authentik is exactly the same process for both Enterprise version and our free open source version.

> This preview version of Enterprise authentik is available within our 2023.8.x release.

## Install Enterprise

To get started working with Enterprise authentik, upgrade to the [2023.8.x](../releases) version or later. For installation steps, refer to our [technical documentation](../installation/index.md) for instructions to install and configure authentik.

-   [Docker Compose installation](../installation/docker-compose.md)
-   [Kubernetes installation](../installation/kubernetes.md)

## Access Enterprise

Access your Enterprise features by first [purchasing a license](./manage-enterprise.md#buy-a-license) for the organization.

The license key provides access to the Customer portal, where you define your organization and its members, manage billing, and access our Support center.

## Visit the Support center

Enterprise authentik provides dedicated support, with a Support center where you can open a request and view the progress and communications for your current requests.

To learn about our Support center, see ["Enterprise support"](./entsupport.md).
