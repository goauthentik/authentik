Installing authentik is exactly the same process for both Enterprise version and our free [open source](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik) version.

> This **_Preview_** version of Enterprise authentik is available with our 2023.8.x release. Send us feedback through the Customer portal or to <hello@goauthentik.io>.

## Install Enterprise

To get started working with Enterprise authentik, upgrade to the [2023.8.x](../releases) version or later. For installation steps, refer to our [technical documentation](../installation/index.md) for instructions to install and configure authentik.

-   [Docker Compose installation](../installation/docker-compose.md)
-   [Kubernetes installation](../installation/kubernetes.md)

## Access Enterprise

Access your Enterprise features by first [purchasing a license](./manage-enterprise.md#buy-a-license) for the organization.

To open the Customer portal and buy a license, go to the Admin interface and in the left pane, navigate to **Enterprise -> Licenses**, and then click **Go to Customer portal**.

The license key provides direct access to the Customer portal, where you define your organization and its members, manage billing, and access our Support center.

## Visit the Support center

Enterprise authentik provides dedicated support, with a Support center where you can open a request and view the progress and communications for your current requests.

To learn about our Support center, see ["Enterprise support"](./entsupport.md).
