title: Get started

Installing authentik is exactly the same process for both Enterprise version and our free [open source](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik) version.

## Install Enterprise

To get started working with Enterprise authentik, [upgrade](../install-config/upgrade.mdx) to the [2023.8.x](../releases) version or later.

If this is a fresh install, refer to our [technical documentation](../install-config/index.mdx) for instructions to install and configure authentik.

- [Docker Compose installation](../install-config/install/docker-compose.mdx)
- [Kubernetes installation](../install-config/install/kubernetes.md)

## Access Enterprise

Access your Enterprise features by first [purchasing a license](./manage-enterprise.md#buy-a-license) for the organization.

To open the Customer Portal and buy a license, go to the Admin interface and in the left pane, navigate to **Enterprise -> Licenses**, and then click **Go to Customer Portal**.

The license key provides direct access to the Customer portal, where you define your organization and its members, manage billing, and access our Support center.

:::info
A license is associated with a specific Organization in the customer portal and a specific authentik instance (with a unique Install ID), and not with individual users. A single license is purchased for a specified number of users. Additional users can be added to a license, or additional licenses purchased for the same instance, if more users need to be added later.

## Visit the Support center

Enterprise authentik provides dedicated support, with a Support center where you can open a request and view the progress and communications for your current requests.
