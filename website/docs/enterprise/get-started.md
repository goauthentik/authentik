Installing authentik is exactly the same process for both the Enterprise version and our open source version. Enterprise features are enabled by installing a license.

## 1. Install authentik

If this is a fresh install, refer to our technical documentation for instructions on how to [install and configure authentik](../install-config/index.mdx).

- [Docker Compose installation](../install-config/install/docker-compose.mdx)
- [Kubernetes installation](../install-config/install/kubernetes.md)

## 2. Purchase an Enterprise license

An authentik Enterprise license can be purchased via our [Customer Portal](https://customers.goauthentik.io/). Alternatively, contact us via hello@goauthentik.io to organize a call to discuss customized licensing, a trial, or your specific needs.

Authentik licenses are linked to a specific authentik deployment based on its Installation ID. You can obtain your Installation ID by first logging in to the Admin interface of your authentik deployment. Then, navigate to **Enterprise** > **Licenses** where your installation ID is displayed.

A license covers a specified number of users, however additional users can be added to a license. Alternatively, additional licenses can be purchased for the same deployment.

For more information on purchasing a license and using the Customer Portal, see [Customer Portal and licensing](./manage-enterprise.mdx).

## 3. Install your license

To install an Enterprise license, first log in to the Admin interface of your authentik deployment.

Navigate to **Enterprise** > **Licenses** and click **Install**. Paste your license key and click **Install**.

The license, its user limit, and expiry date are then displayed.

## 4. Accessing support

Enterprise authentik provides dedicated support for subscriptions over $1000 per year, with a Support center where you can open and track tickets.

To learn about our Support center, see [Enterprise support](./enterprise-support.md).
