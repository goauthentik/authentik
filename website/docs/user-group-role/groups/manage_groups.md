Groups are collection of users. Refer to the following sections to learn how to create and manage groups, assign users and roles to groups, and how [permissions](../access-control/permissions.md) work on a group level.

## Create a group

vvvv

## Modify a group

fffff

## Delete a group

hhhhhh

## Assign, modify, or remove permissions for a group

You can grant a group specific global or object-level permissions. Any user who is a member of a group inherits all of the group's permissions.

For more information, review ["Permissions: global and object-level"](../access-control/permissions.md).

## Assign a role to a group

You can assign a role to a group, and then all users in the group inherit the permissions assigned to that role. For instructions and more information, see ["Assign a role to a group"](../roles/manage_roles.md#assign-a-role-to-a-group).
