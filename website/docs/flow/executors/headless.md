The headless flow executor is used by clients that don't have access to the web interface. It is currently used by the LDAP and Radius outposts to authenticate users.

The following stages are supported:

-   [**Identification stage**](../stages/identification/)
-   [**Password stage**](../stages/password/)
-   [**Authenticator Validation Stage**](../stages/authenticator_validate/)
