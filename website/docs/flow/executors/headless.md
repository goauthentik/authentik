The headless flow executor is used by clients which don't have access to the web interface. It is currently used by the LDAP outpost to authenticate users.

The following stages are supported:

-   [**identification**](../stages/identification/)
-   [**password**](../stages/password/)
-   [**authenticator_validate**](../stages/authenticator_validate/)
