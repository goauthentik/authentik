After you have installed and started authentik, you are now ready to add your first application and provider, add some users, and get started with using authentik as your SSO and IdP.

## How did we get here?

The following tutorial assumes that you have already:

1. Installed and started authentik on either [Docker Compose](../install-config/install/docker-compose.mdx#install-and-start-authentik) or [Kubernetes](../install-config/install/kubernetes.md#install-authentik-helm-chart).

2. Opened authentik in your browser and added credentials for a default Admin account. ([Docker](../install-config/install/docker-compose.mdx#access-authentik) or [Kubernetes](../install-config/install/kubernetes.md#access-authentik)).
