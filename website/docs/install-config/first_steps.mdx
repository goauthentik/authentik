title: First steps

After you have installed and started authentik, you are now ready to add your first application and provider, add some users, and get started with using authentik as your SSO and IdP.

## How did we get here?

The following tutorial assumes that you have already:

1. Installed authentik on either [Docker Compose](../install-config/install/docker-compose.mdx#install-and-start-authentik) or [Kubernetes](../install-config/install/kubernetes.md#install-authentik-helm-chart), and then started the server and worker.

2. Opened authentik in your browser and added credentials for a default Admin account. ([Docker](../install-config/install/docker-compose.mdx#access-authentik) or [Kubernetes](../install-config/install/kubernetes.md#access-authentik)).

:::info Initial setup in browser
If your attempt to open authentik in the browser using the URL with the `initial-setup` flow does not work, verify that you have a trailing slash on the end of the URL. Also verify that your server and worker are running.
:::

Other optional configurations that you might have already completed include:

- [Configured your global email address](../email/#global-email-settings)
- [Set your environment variables](../configuration/#set-your-environment-variables), and [verified them](../configuration/#verify-your-configuration-settings)
- installed a production-ready Postgres DB
- configured your Postgres settings (read-replica, connections, etc)
- configure your storage settings
- configure custom ports

## Install your first application and provider

Now that you have your authentik instance installed and configured with the required settings, you can add your first [application](../core/glossary/terms/application.mdx) and [provider](../core/glossary/terms/provider.mdx). Authentik supports hundreds of applications; refer to our [Integrations documentation](https://integrations.goauthentik.io/index.mdx) to view integrations guides for many common ones.

After that, we'll walk through how to add users, groups, and roles.

### Configure authentik

For this walk-through, let's use [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) as the example application to install, with an OAuth2/OIDC provider. These steps are purposefully simplified, to get you up and going with a new application, but for the full details refer to our [Grafana integration guide](https://integrations.goauthentik.io/monitoring/grafana/).

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair.
3. Provide the details for the application and provider. For guidance on each specific field, refer to the refer to our [Grafana integration guide](https://integrations.goauthentik.io/monitoring/grafana/).
4. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

### Configure Grafana

Next you need to configure your Grafana application to use authentik as its IdP. These steps are for a Grafana instance that is running in Docker; if you are running authentik in Kubernetes or as a standalone instance, refer to the [Grafana integration guide](https://integrations.goauthentik.io/monitoring/grafana/).

Set the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```yaml
environment:
    GF_AUTH_GENERIC_OAUTH_ENABLED: "true"
    GF_AUTH_GENERIC_OAUTH_NAME: "authentik"
    GF_AUTH_GENERIC_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID: "<Client ID from above>"
    GF_AUTH_GENERIC_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET: "<Client Secret from above>"
    GF_AUTH_GENERIC_OAUTH_SCOPES: "openid profile email"
    GF_AUTH_GENERIC_OAUTH_AUTH_URL: "https://authentik.company/application/o/authorize/"
    GF_AUTH_GENERIC_OAUTH_TOKEN_URL: "https://authentik.company/application/o/token/"
    GF_AUTH_GENERIC_OAUTH_API_URL: "https://authentik.company/application/o/userinfo/"
    GF_AUTH_SIGNOUT_REDIRECT_URL: "https://authentik.company/application/o/<application_slug>/end-session/"
    # Optionally enable auto-login (bypasses Grafana login screen)
    GF_AUTH_OAUTH_AUTO_LOGIN: "true"
    # Optionally map user groups to Grafana roles
    GF_AUTH_GENERIC_OAUTH_ROLE_ATTRIBUTE_PATH: "contains(groups[*], 'Grafana Admins') && 'Admin' || contains(groups[*], 'Grafana Editors') && 'Editor' || 'Viewer'"
    # Required if Grafana is running behind a reverse proxy
    GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL: "https://grafana.company"
```

### Configuration verification

To confirm that authentik is properly configured with Grafana, log out and log back in using an account that is a member of the appropriate authentik group (e.g. grafana-administrators).

## Add your first users

Now that you can access the authentik Admin interface, and you have added an application and provider, let's add a couple of users and assign them appropriate groups and roles.

TODO add basic steps here with lots of handholding tips....

## Things to know and troubleshooting tips

### Modifying the docker compose file

Especially when you are just starting out with authentik, we recommend that you use the default `docker-compose.yml` file that comes with the download, instead of trying to write the file from scratch. After you have successfully installed, configured, and accessed authentik, you can edit the file to do more advanced configs documented in the [Configuration section](../install-config/configuration/configuration.mdx).

### Reverse proxy

authentik is typically set up with a reverse proxy in front of it. TODO WORDS HERE ABOUT WHY. For more details see the [Reverse proxy guide](./reverse-proxy.md).

### The `latest` tag is deprecated

We highly recommend against using the `:latest` tag with container images because it can lead to unintentional updates and potentially broken setups. Instead, use a specific version tag for authentik instances' container images, such as `:2025.12`.

### Using bindings to allow or restrict access to applications

Note that if you do not define any bindings, then all users have access to the application. For more information about user access, refer to our documentation about [authorization](../add-secure-apps/applications/manage_apps.mdx#policy-driven-authorization) and [hiding an application](../add-secure-apps/applications/manage_apps.mdx#hide-applications).

These are all one or two sentences, then link to full docs

- using federated sources, link to full docs on sources)
- set up MFA
- define property mappings
- create a custom flow
- reverse proxy
- install an enterprise license
- create a simple policy (?)
