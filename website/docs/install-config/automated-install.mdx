title: Automated install
---

To install authentik automatically (skipping the Out-of-box experience), you can use the following environment variables on the worker container:

:::info
These can't be defined using the file-based syntax (`file://`), so you can't pass them in as secrets in a docker-compose install.
:::

### `AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD`

Configure the default password for the `akadmin` user. Only read on the first startup. Can be used for any flow executor.

### `AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`

Create a token for the default `akadmin` user. Only read on the first startup. The string you specify for this variable is the token key you can use to authenticate yourself to the API.

### `AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_EMAIL`

Set the email address for the default `akadmin` user.

## Kubernetes

In the Helm values, set the `akadmin` user password and token:

```yaml
authentik:
    bootstrap_token: test
    bootstrap_password: test
```

To store the password and token in a secret, use:

```yaml
global:
    envFrom:
        - secretRef:
              name: _some-secret_
```

where _some-secret_ contains the environment variables as in the documentation above.
