### Assign 'Can view Admin interface` permissions'

You can grant regular users, who are not superusers nor Admins, the right to view the Admin interface. This can be useful in scenarios where you have a team who needs to be able to create certain objects (flows, other users, etc) but who should not have full access to the Admin interface.

To assign the `Can view Admin interface` permission to a user (follow the same steps for a role):

1. Go to the Admin interface and navigate to **Directory -> User**.
2. Select a specific user the clicking on the user's name.
3. Click the **Permissions** tab at the top of the page.
4. Click **Assigned Global Permissions** to the left.
5. In the **Assign permissions** area, click **Assign Permission**.
6. In the **Assign permission to user** box, click the plus sign (**+**), enter `admin` in the Search field and click the search icon.
7. Select the returned permission, click **Add**, and then click **Assign** to save your changes and close the box.

Be aware that any rights beyond viewing will need to be assigned as well; for example, if you want a non-Admin user to be able to create flows in the Admin interface, you need to grant those object permissions.
