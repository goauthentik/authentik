Initial Permissions automatically assign [object-level permissions](https://www.notion.so/authentiksecurity/permissions#object-permissions) between a newly created object and its creator.

Describe basics of this feature

## Common use cases

write about example that Gergo did  but broaden to make clear it is al=bout all objects

Mention this will be an Admin creating the IP.

Mention that if they are not super-users or Admins, they will need to have the Can view Admin interface permission. (??)

Describe the scenario of a group of semi-admins who all do the same job and need to be able to share tasks and view/modify each others' work.

Mode field also solves the problem of the original SemiAdmin user cannot see an object created by another user.

## High-level workflow

The fundamantal steps to implement initial permissions are as follows:

1. Create a role, to which the initial permissions will be assigned.
2. Create a group, and assign the new role to it, and add any members that you want to use the initial permissions set. You can also create new users later, and add them to the group.
3. Create an initial permissions object, and assign all needed permissions to it.
4. Optionally, create additiikoanl users and add them to the group to which the role is assigned.

Because the new initial permissions object is coupled with the role (and that role is assigned to a group), the initial permissions object is applied automatically to any new objects (users or flows or any object) that the member user creates.

## Create and implement initial permissions

To create a new set of initial permissions and apply them to either a single user or a role (and every user with that role), follow these steps.

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. To [create a new role](../roles/manage_roles.md) navigate to **Directory** > **Roles** to and click **Create**.

3. To [create a new group](../groups/manage_groups.mdx) navigate to **Directory** > **Groups** and click **Create**. After creating the group:

    - [assign the new role to the group](../groups/manage_groups.mdx#assign-a-role-to-a-group)
    - [add any members](../user/user_basic_operations.md#add-a-user-to-a-group) who you want to use the Initial Permissions. You can add already existing users, or [create new users](../user/user_basic_operations.md#create-a-user).

4. To create an Initial Permissions object, navigate to **Directory** > **Initial Permissions** and click **Create**. Configure the followoing settings:

    - **Name**: Provide a descriptive name for the new initial permissions object.

    - **Role**: Select the role to which you want to apply initial permissions. When a user who is a member of a group with this role assigned creates an object, Initial Permissions will be applied to that object.

    - **Mode**: select whether you want to attach the intiital permisison to a role or to a single user.

        - **Role**: select this to allow everyone with that role (i.e. everyone in a group to which this role is assigned) to be able to see each others' users.

        - **User**: the Initial Permissions will apply _only_ to the user creating the object.

    - **Permissions**: select all permissions to add to the initial permissions object.

5. Optionally, create new users and add them to the group. Each new user added to the group will automaticlaly have the set of permissions assign in the initial permissions object.
