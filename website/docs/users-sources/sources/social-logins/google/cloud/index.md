## authentik configuration

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Directory** > **Federation and Social login**, click **Create**, and then configure the following settings:
    - **Select type**: select **GitHub OAuth Source** as the source type.
    - **Create Facebook OAuth Source**: provide a name, set the slug to `google`, and set the following required configurations:
        - **Protocol settings**
            - **Consumer Key**: <client_ID>
            - **Consumer Secret**: <client_secret>

For instructions on how to display the new source on the authentik login page, refer to the [Add sources to default login page documentation](../../index.md#add-sources-to-default-login-page).

## Optional additional configuration

### Username mapping

Google does not have the concept of a username, therefore authentik will by default prompt the user for a username when they first enroll through a google source. To change this behaviour and automatically use the email address as username, create an expression policy to set the username to the email, and bind it to the enrollment flow.

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Customization** > **Policies**.
3. Click **Create**, select **Expression Policy** and then **Next**.
4. Provide a name for the policy and set the following expression:

```python
email = request.context["prompt_data"]["email"]
# Direct set username to email

request.context["prompt_data"]["username"] = email
# Set username to email without domain
# request.context["prompt_data"]["username"] = email.split("@")[0]
return False
```

5. Click **Finish**. You can now bind this policy to the chosen enrollment flow of the Google OAuth source.
6. Navigate to **Flows and Stages** > **Flows** and click the name of the flow in question.
7. Open the **Stage Bindings** tab, expand the policies bound to the first stage and click **Bind existing Policy/Group/User**.
8. Select the policy that you previously created and click **Create**.

:::note
If using the default enrollment flow the policy should be bound to the **default-source-enrollment-prompt** stage. Ensure that the policy comes before **default-source-enrollment-if-username**
:::

Afterwards, any new logins will automatically have their google email address used as their username. This can be combined with disallowing users from changing their usernames, see [Configuration](../../../../../sys-mgmt/settings.md#allow-users-to-change-username).
