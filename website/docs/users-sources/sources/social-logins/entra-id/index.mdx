Entra ID provides several services that can be integrated with authentik:

    - OAuth integration allows users to sign into authentik using their Entra ID credentials. Accounts and groups are created upon first login.
    - SCIM integration provisions users and groups from Entra ID to authentik.
    - Optionally, both integrations can be used in conjunction so that users and groups are provisioned before a user signs in.

## OAuth

Entra ID provides OAuth 2.0 as a federated identity provider. This guide covers how to set up OAuth 2.0 as an authentication method between Entra ID and authentik.
