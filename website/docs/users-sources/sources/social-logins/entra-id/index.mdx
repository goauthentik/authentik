Entra ID provides several services that can be integrated with authentik:

    - **OAuth integration** allows users to sign into authentik using their Entra ID credentials. Accounts and groups are created upon first login.
    - **SCIM integration** provisions users and groups from Entra ID to authentik.
    - Optionally, both integrations can be used in conjunction so that users and groups are provisioned before a user signs in using their Entra ID credentials. This is the recommended setup for organizations with large numbers of users and groups.

## OAuth

The [Entra ID OAuth](./oauth/index.mdx) guide explains how to set up OAuth 2.0 as an authentication method between Entra ID and authentik.

## SCIM

The [Entra ID SCIM](./scim/index.mdx) guide explains how you can provision users and groups from Entra ID into authentik via SCIM.
