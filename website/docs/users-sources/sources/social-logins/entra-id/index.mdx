Entra ID provides several services that can be integrated with authentik:

## OAuth

The [Entra ID OAuth](./oauth/index.mdx) guide explains how to set up Entra ID as a federated OAuth identity provider for authentik.

This enables users to sign into authentik using their Entra ID credentials. User accounts are created in authentik upon first login and updated on each subsequent login.

Alternatively, Entra ID authentication can be embedded into a flow via a [Source stage](../../../../../add-secure-apps/flows-stages/stages/source).

## SCIM

The [Entra ID SCIM](./scim/index.mdx) guide explains how you can provision users and groups from Entra ID into authentik via the SCIM protocol.

Optionally, both the OAuth and SCIM integrations can be used in conjunction so that users and groups are provisioned before a user signs in using their Entra ID credentials. This is the recommended setup for organizations with large numbers of users and groups.
