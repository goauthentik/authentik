## Preparation

The following placeholders are used in this guide:

- `svc_authentik` is the name of the bind account.
- `freeipa.company` is the Name of the domain.
- `ipa1.freeipa.company` is the Name of the FreeIPA server.

## FreeIPA Setup

1. Log in to FreeIPA.

2. Create a user in FreeIPA, matching your naming scheme. Provide a strong password, example generation methods: `pwgen 64 1` or `openssl rand 36 | base64 -w 0`. After you are done click **Add and Edit**.

3. In the user management screen, select the Roles tab.

4. Add a role that has privileges to change user passwords, the default `User Administrators` role is sufficient. This is needed to support password resets from within authentik.

5. By default, if an administrator account resets a user's password in FreeIPA the user's password expires after the first use and must be reset again. This is a security feature to ensure password complexity and history policies are enforced. To bypass this feature for a more seamless experience, you can make the following modification on each of your FreeIPA servers:

    ```
    $ ldapmodify -x -D "cn=Directory Manager" -W -h ipa1.freeipa.company -p 389

    dn: cn=ipa_pwd_extop,cn=plugins,cn=config
    changetype: modify
    add: passSyncManagersDNs
    passSyncManagersDNs: uid=svc_authentik,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=freeipa,dc=company
    ```

## authentik Setup

:::note
This documentation lists only the settings that you need to change from their default values. Be aware that any changes other than those explicitly mentioned in this guide could cause issues accessing your application.

All the settings are described in [LDAP sources](../../protocols/ldap/index.mdx).
:::

In authentik, create a new LDAP Source: go to **Directory** > **Federation and Social Login**, click **Create**,
select **LDAP source**.

These settings are required for FreeIPA: 

- **Name**: `Company FreeIPA`
- **Slug**: `company-freeipa`
- **Update internal password on login**: enable if you want your users to be able to login if FreeIPA is not accessible
- **Delete not found object**: enable to delete users from Authentik when they are deleted in FreIPA

### Connection settings

- **Server URI**: `ldaps://ipa1.freeipa.company`

    :::tip
    You can specify multiple servers by separating URIs with a comma, like `ldap://ipa1.freeipa.company,ldap://ipa2.freeipa.company`.

    When using a DNS entry with multiple Records, authentik will select a random entry when first connecting.
    :::

- **Enable StartTLS**: enable for `ldap://` protocol, disable for `ldaps://`
- **TLS Verification Certificate**: **FIXME**
- **Bind CN**: `uid=svc_authentik,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=freeipa,dc=company`
- **Bind Password**: The password you've given the user above
- **Base DN**: `dc=freeipa,dc=company`

### LDAP Attribute mapping

- **User Property Mappings**: Control/Command-select all Mappings which start with "authentik default LDAP" and "authentik default OpenLDAP". Remove others that are selected by default.
- **Group property mappings**: Select "authentik default OpenLDAP Mapping: cn"

### Additional settings

- **Parent Group**: If selected, all synchronized groups will be given this group as a parent.
- **User Path**: `company/freeipa` for instance, this setting is not crucial.
- **Addition User/Group DN**: `cn=users,cn=accounts`
- **Addition Group DN**: `cn=groups,cn=accounts`
- **User object filter**: `(objectClass=person)`
- **Group object filter**: `(objectClass=groupofnames)`
- **Group membership field**: `memberOf`
- **User membership attribute**: `distinguishedName`
- **Lookup using user attribute**: *enabled*.
- **Object uniqueness field**: `ipaUniqueID`

:::caution
In FreeIPA, groups can have other groups as members. Indirect member users are not listed in the parent group's `member` attribute.
Because of this, the sync havs to be done by the user's attribute `memberOf`. These are present for every membership, even indirect one.

In the improbable case that you want to sync only direct memberships, you can use the following settings:
- Group membership field: `member`
- User membership attribute: `distinguishedName`
- Lookup using user attribute: *disabled*
:::

## Manual synchronization

After you save the source, you can kick off a synchronization by navigating to the source, clicking on the **Sync** tab, and clicking the **Run sync again** button.

Lastly, verify that the **User database + LDAP password** backend is selected in the **Password Stage** under **Flows and Stages > Stages**
