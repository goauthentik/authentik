You can test upcoming authentik versions by switching to the _next_ images. It is recommended to upgrade to the latest stable release before upgrading to Beta images. It is always possible to upgrade from the Beta to the next stable release.

:::warning
Downgrading from the Beta is not supported. It is recommended to take a backup before upgrading, or test Beta versions on a separate install. Upgrading from Beta versions to the next release is usually possible, however also not supported.
