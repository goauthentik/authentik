title: Upgrade authentik
---

Upgrading to the latest version of authentik, whether a new major release or a patch, involves running a few commands to pull down the latest packages and then restart the servers and databases.

:::warning
The version of the authentik instance and any outposts must be the same. We recommended that you always upgrade any outposts at the same time you upgrade your authentik instance.

If you run the upgrade commands but your version on the Dashboard doesn’t change,you might need to make sure the old `authinstall database`` is removed before upgrading.

Run `docker compose down -v`.

If you run the upgrade commands but your version on the Dashboard doesn’t change, follow these steps:

1.  Run `helm repo add authentik https://charts.goauthentik.io`
2.  Then run `kubectl rollout restart deployment` to force the system to pick up the latest version.
3.  Finally, run the upgrade commands again:

        `helm repo update

    helm upgrade --install authentik authentik/authentik -f values.yaml`

TODOs:

-   Add link to Release Notes (and from Release Notes to here)

-` Do we need to mention this? "For arm64 platforms, append`-arm64` to the tag name (no spaces)."

-   What other tips and info do they need?
