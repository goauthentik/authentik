title: Upgrade authentik
---

Upgrading to the latest version of authentik, whether a new major release or a patch, involves running a few commands to pull down the latest images and then restart the servers and databases.

For information about a specific version, refer to our [Release Notes](../releases/).

:::warning

-   Be sure to make a backup of your databases before upgrading.

-   The version of the authentik instance and any outposts must be the same. We recommended that you always upgrade any outposts at the same time you upgrade your authentik instance.

In your terminal, navigate to your installation directory and follow these steps:

#### 1. Retrieve latest `docker-compose.yml` file

-   Linux: `wget -O docker-compose.yml https://goauthentik.io/docker-compose.yml`

    The `-O` flag retains the downloaded file's name, overwriting any existing local file with the same name.

-   MacOS: `curl -O https://goauthentik.io/docker-compose.yml`

#### 2. Run upgrade commands

    ```shell
    docker compose pull
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## Verify your upgrade

You can view the current version of your authentik instance by logging in to the Admin interface, and then navigating to **Dashboards -> Overview**.

If you run the upgrade commands but your version on the Dashboard doesn’t change, you might need to make sure the old `authinstall database` is removed before upgrading.

:::warning
Be aware that this command purges the Docker volumes (which hold the instance's data).
:::

Run `docker compose down -v`.

If you run the upgrade commands but your version on the Dashboard doesn’t change, follow these steps:

1.  Run `helm repo add authentik https://charts.goauthentik.io`
2.  Then run `kubectl rollout restart deployment` to force the system to pick up the latest version.
3.  Finally, run the upgrade commands again:
    ```
    helm repo update
    helm upgrade --install authentik authentik/authentik -f values.yaml
    ```
