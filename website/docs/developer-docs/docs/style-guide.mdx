title: Style Guide
---

This Style Guide provides guidelines to ensure that the authentik documentation is consistent, clear, and easy to follow. It standardizes aspects like phrasing, formatting, tone, and structure across all documentation.

We appreciate all contributions to our documentation — whether it's fixing a typo, adding new content, or writing an entirely new topic. To help us review and merge your contributions more efficiently, please follow our [writing documentation](./writing-documentation.md) guidelines. If you notice any inconsistencies, feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/issues) or submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/pulls) to fix them.

## General style guidelines

### Logical order

- Documentation should be structured to follow the natural order of tasks, making it easier for users to follow. Organize sections in a manner that reflects the actual workflow used to complete tasks.

- When writing procedural documentation (How Tos) the steps should follow the workflow in the UI, specifying the exact pages to navigate and the precise fields, tabs, etc., to select or complete. Present the UI components in the document in the same order they appear in the UI.

### Headings

Use headings (sub-titles) to break up large blocks of text, making it easier for users to navigate the content and find specific sections quickly.

### Look and feel of the docs

In general, the visual, aesthetics of the technical documentation is intended to be lean and clean. Both the content (shorter sentences, concise instructions, etc) and the layout strive to have a clean, uncluttered look, with restrained use of colors and large callouts or announcements. Relatedly, the colors used for our Info and Warning callouts, light blue and light yellow respectively, are reserved for those purposes only.

### Cross-references

Always include cross-references to related content. If a concept is referenced elsewhere in the documentation, link to the relevant section to provide users with additional context or instructions.

### Relative vs. absolute paths

Use relative paths when linking to other documentation files. This will ensure links are automatically updated if file paths change in the future. If you are linking between another authentik resource that is not in the same repository and our regular technical docs, then use an absolute path.

### Markdown file type

The standard file type for documentation is `.md`. Use `.mdx` only if React components, such as interactive elements, are required.

### OS-agnostic, clarify where needed

Try to write procedural (How To) docs generically enough that it does not endorse or force a specific operating system. If it is necessary to specify a specific OS be sure to label it clearly. Consider using tabs (with MDX) to show the different OSes.

## Terminology

### authentik product name and terms

- The product name **authentik** should always be written with a lowercase "a" and a "k" at the end, even if it begins a sentence.

- The company name is **Authentik Security, Inc.**, but for non-legal documentation, you may shorten it to **Authentik Security**.

- When referring to the authentik Admin interface, capitalize "Admin" like it is in the UI, but do not bold the phrase "Admin interface" unless in a sentence that explicitly says "Click on **Admin interface**". However, if you are referring to a user or role that is an administrator, or has administrative rights, then do not capitalize it and spell out the full word "administrator" or "administrative".

### Industry terms and technology names

- When referring to external tools or industry terms, always use the exact capitalization and naming conventions that the product or company uses. Refer to their website or official documentation for the proper formatting. For example, use "OAuth", "SAML", or "Docker" as per the official conventions.
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are well-known and widely recognized (e.g., SSO, MFA, RBAC).
- If an acronym is used less frequently, spell out its full meaning when first mentioned on the page, followed by the acronym in parentheses. In some cases the acronym can come first, followed by the full term in parentheses.

### Trademarks and Legal Terms

- Respect third-party trademarks. Use the correct symbols (™, ®) where applicable (e.g., "GitHub®", "Okta™").
- When mentioning third-party products, follow their branding guidelines (e.g., "GitHub", not "Github").
- Where appropriate, include required legal disclaimers when referencing external services or integrations.

---

## Writing style

### Tone

The tone of the authentik documentation should be friendly but professional. It should be approachable, yet not overly casual. When appropriate, address the reader directly using second-person pronouns (e.g., "Next, you need to configure the login settings").

### Language

The documentation uses **American English** spelling conventions (e.g., "customize" instead of "customise").

### Voice

Use **active voice** and **present tense** for clear, direct communication.

- **DON'T:** "The Applications page will be loaded."
- **DO:** "The Applications page displays."

### User-friendly phrasing

Avoid phrasing that blames the user. Be subjective and polite when providing instructions.

- **DON'T:** "Never modify the default file."
- **DO:** "We recommend that you do not modify the default file, as doing so may result in unexpected issues."

### Punctuation

For Ken's sake, and many others, try to not use too many commas (avoid commaitis). Use a comma when needed to separate clauses, or for "slowing the pace" or clarity. Please **do** use the [Serial comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) (also known as the Oxford comma).

### Capitalization

#### Titles and headers

Titles and headers (H1, H2, H3, etc.) should follow **sentence case capitalization**, meaning only the first word is capitalized, except for proper nouns or product names. For more information, see [below](#titles-and-headers).

#### Following a colon

Whether to capitalize after a colon depends on the context. Typically, we do not capitalize the first word after a colon _unless_ it's a proper noun or if it is the start of a complete sentence. If the colon introduces a list, do not capitalize the first word unless it's a proper noun. In headings and titles, capitalize the first word after the colon.

---

## Word choices

### "May" versus "Might" versus "Can"

- Typically, avoid using the word "may" in technical writing, as it implies permission rather than ability to perform an action. Instead, use **"can"** to suggest possibility.
- **"Might"** should be used to indicate that something could happen under certain conditions, but use it sparingly. It implies unpredictability, which can be undesirable in software documentation.

    - **DON'T:** "You may use an Expression policy to enforce MFA adherence."
    - **DO:** "You can use an Expression policy to enforce MFA adherence."
    - **DO:** "Values might differ depending on the source of the property mappings."

### "Login", "Log in", and "Log in to"

- As a noun or descriptive term, use **login** (e.g., "The login panel").
- As a verb, use **"log in"** (e.g., "This stage prompts the user to log in").
- As a verb followed by the proposition **"to"**, use **"log in to"** (e.g., "Log in to the application").

### Use "that" as a conjunction

It's important to use "that" as a conjunction to introduce a dependent clause, or as a "connection" between a noun and a verb ("The provider that you created in Step 3."). Including "that" as a conjunction helps non-native English speakers more easily parse phrases, and improves output for translation tools.

- **DO:** "Ensure that the new user's password is valid."
- **DON'T:** "Ensure the new user's password is valid."

### "which" vs "that"

The easiest way to remember when to use "which" versus "that" is:

- If the second part (clause) of the sentence is required to understand the first part, use "that." If the second clause is only additional info, use "which".

For more information, see [this guide](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/which-vs-that/).

### "since" (time-based) vs "because" (causal)

When writing about a status or anything that is causal ("this happened because of that"), use the word "because". Use the word "since" for time-based topics (this will be rare in technical writing).

### Avoid using "once" (numeric) to mean "after" (time-based).

When writing out steps in a procedural topic, avoid starting with "Once...". Instead, you can say "After you have created the scope mapping...".

## Formatting guidelines

### Fonts and font styling

- When referring to internal components in authentik, like the policy engine, or blueprints, do not use any special formatting, and do not capitalize. Link to the relevant documentation when possible.

- When referring to authentik functionality and features, such as flows, stages, sources, or policies, do not capitalize and do not use bold or italic text. When possible link to the corresponding documentation.

- Use **bold** to highlight:

    - UI elements such as field names, labels, buttons, or options (e.g., **Save** button, **Username** field).
    - Key actions in instructions (e.g., **Click Next**).

- Use _italic_ for:

    - Emphasis, but sparingly, to avoid overuse. For example, you can use italics for important terms or concepts on first mention in a section.

- Use `code formatting` for:

    - Commands (e.g., `kubectl get nodes`).
    - File paths, file names, and directory names (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/`).
    - Inline code snippets (e.g., `.env`).

- When handling URLs:

    - For URLs entered as values or defined in fields, enclose any variables inside angle brackets (`< >`) to clearly indicate that these are placeholders that require user input.

        For example: `https://authentik.company/application/o/<slug>/.well-known/openid-configuration`

    - When mentioning URLs in text or within procedural instructions, omit code formatting. For instance: "In your browser, go to https://example.com."

### Titles and headers

- Titles and headers (H1, H2, H3) should follow **sentence case capitalization**, meaning only the first word is capitalized, except for proper nouns or product names.

    - **DO:** "Configure the Google Workspace provider"
    - **DON'T:** "CONFIGURE THE GOOGLE WORKSPACE PROVIDER"
    - **DON'T:** "Configure The Google Workspace Provider"

- Ensure titles and headers are descriptive and clearly convey the purpose of the section. Avoid vague titles like "Overview." Instead, opt for something more specific, like "About authentik policies."

- Use the **imperative verb form** in procedural topics, not gerunds. For example, use "Configure your instance" instead of "Configuring your instance."

### Examples

When you want to show an example (say, a code snippet), start on a new line, use bold text for the word "Example", and a semi-colon, like this:

**Example**:

    This expression policy uses an expression based on the user's name:
    ```python
    if request.context["pending_user"].username == "marie":
        return True
    return False
    ```

### Code blocks

When you want to show sections of code use **Code blocks** to provide syntax highlighting, a copy button, line numbering and line highlighting:

```text
` ` ` yaml showLineNumbers {5} title="/etc/wazuh-indexer/opensearch-security/roles_mapping.yml"
all_access:
reserved: true
hidden: false
backend_roles:
    - "wazuh-admin"
    - "admin"
hosts: []
users: []
and_backend_roles: []
description: "Maps admin to all_access"
` ` `
```

Which is rendered as:

```yaml showLineNumbers {5} title="/etc/wazuh-indexer/opensearch-security/roles_mapping.yml"
all_access:
reserved: true
hidden: false
backend_roles:
    - "wazuh-admin"
    - "admin"
hosts: []
users: []
and_backend_roles: []
description: "Maps admin to all_access"
```

- ` ` ` `yaml ` defines the language used for syntax highlighting. Other languages can be used such as `jsx`, `python`, `bash`, and `text`.

Optional configurations:

- `showLineNumbers`: enables line numbering.
- `title=" "`: defines the title displayed at the top (e.g., filenames).
- `{5}`: highlights specific lines. Ranges and lists are allowed (e.g., `{5, 7, 9-11}`).
- `// highlight-next-line`: highlights the next line within a code block.
- `// highlight-start` and `// highlight-end`: highlight multiple lines.

For more details, see the [Docusaurus code block documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/code-blocks).

### Tables

Use tables to compare options, list parameters, or summarize information. Ensure tables are concise and avoid nesting complex content. Only use a table when there are 4 or more items. For only 2 or 3 items, use a bullet list.

**Example**:

| x   | x | x |
|-----|--|----|
| `x` | x | `x` |
| `x` | x | `x` |

### Lists

- Use bullet points for unordered lists.
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps.
- Keep list items parallel in structure.

**Example**:

x:
1. x
2. y
3. z

---

## Component-based formatting

### Tabs for multiple configurations

Use **Tabs** to display different configurations (e.g., setting up authentication with OIDC vs. SAML) to help users navigate between options. Default to the easier or more common option. For example:

```jsx
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";

<Tabs
    defaultValue="oidc"
    values={[
        { label: "OIDC", value: "oidc" },
        { label: "SAML", value: "saml" },
    ]}
>
    <TabItem value="oidc">OIDC configuration details go here.</TabItem>
    <TabItem value="saml">SAML configuration details go here.</TabItem>
</Tabs>;
```

---

## Error message formatting and troubleshooting

When documenting errors, follow this structure:

1. **Error Message**: Display the error in a code block.
2. **Possible Causes**: List common reasons for the error.
3. **Solutions**: Provide step-by-step fixes or a work-around if there is one.

**Example**:

- **Error message**:
    ```sh
    Error: Authentication failed. Invalid credentials.
    ```

- **Possible causes**:
    - Incorrect username or password.
    - Account locked due to multiple failed attempts.

- **Solutions**:
    1. Verify your credentials.
    2. Reset your password using the **Forgot Password** link.
    3. Contact your administrator if the account is locked.

---

## Accessibility best practices

- **Alt text for images**: Describe the purpose of the image, not just its appearance. For example, use "Screenshot of the login form" instead of "Image of a form."
- **Heading hierarchy**: Use headings in order (H1 → H2 → H3) to support screen readers.
- **Color usage**: Avoid using color as the sole method of conveying information (e.g., "Click the red button"). Instead, use descriptive labels to ensure accessibility.
- **Descriptive link text**: Provide descriptive link text. Avoid using generic terms like "Click here". Be specific about where the link will take the user.
    - **DON'T:** "Click here."
    - **DO:** "See the [Authentication Settings](/) for more details."

---

## Notes and warnings

Use the following components to highlight important information:

**Info notes**:
```md
:::info
This is a tip or general note.
:::
```

**Warnings**:
```md
:::warning
This level is for more serious situations: an action cannot be undone, a process might be canceled, etc..
:::
```

**Critical warnings** (for irreversible actions):
```md
:::danger
This level is for extremely serious situations, such as an action permanently removing data.
:::
```

---

## Inclusive Language

- Use **gender-neutral pronouns** like "they/them" instead of "he/she" (e.g., "The user should check their settings").
- Avoid **ableist terms** such as "dumb" or "lame"; use "non-functional" or "unavailable" instead.
- **Avoid idioms** that may not translate well (e.g., instead of "hit a home run" use "achieve success").

---

## Images and Media

- **Screenshots**:
    - Use screenshots very sparingly, only for very complex UIs. If there are screenshots, update any existing ones if the UI changes.
    - Crop to focus on relevant elements, use red arrows or circles to call out the important element.
    - Add descriptive alt text (e.g., "Screenshot of the Provider configuration page").
- **Diagrams**: 
    - Use [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for creating diagrams directly in markdown. Mermaid is our preferred tool for documentation diagrams as it allows for version control and easy updates.
    - For more complex diagrams, you can use tools like [Draw.io](https://draw.io). Ensure high contrast and text descriptions.

---

## Document Structure and Metadata

- **Front matter**: Include a title and optional summary. You can also add badge metadata in the front matter:
    ```md
    ---
    title: Getting Started
    description: Install and configure authentik in 5 minutes.
    authentik_version: "2025.4"  # Semantic version when feature was introduced (Optional)
    authentik_preview: true      # For preview features (Optional)
    authentik_enterprise: true   # For enterprise features (Optional)
    support_level: "authentik"   # For integrations: Support level: "authentik" (tested by team) or "community" (community maintained)
    ---
    ```

    Note: Badges should be defined in the front matter, not in the markdown content. The system will automatically display the appropriate badges based on the front matter metadata.

- **Directives**: You can also use directives in your markdown content to add badges inline:
    - `:ak-version[2025.4]` - Shows when a feature was introduced (requires semantic version)
    - `:ak-preview` - Indicates preview features
    - `:ak-enterprise` - Indicates features in our Enterprise offering

    Example usage in a heading:
    ```md
    # New Feature :ak-version[2025.4] :ak-preview
    ```

    Note: When using directives, they should be placed at the end of the heading or paragraph where they apply.

- **SEO**: Use keywords in titles and headings to improve searchability. Include relevant terms that users might search for, but avoid keyword stuffing. Focus on natural, descriptive language that accurately represents the content.
