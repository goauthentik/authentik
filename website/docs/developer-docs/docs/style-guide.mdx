title: Style Guide

The Style Guide provides guidelines to ensure that the authentik documentation is easy to read and uses similar phrasing, formatting, and tone.

We appreciate contributions to our documentation; everything from fixing a typo to adding additional content to writing a completely new topic. To make the review and merging of your contributions faster and easier, please follow the [writing documentation](./writing-documentation.md) guidelines.

If you find any documentation that doesn't match these guidelines, feel free to either open an [Issue](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/issues) or a [PR](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/pulls) so they can be fixed.

## General style guidelines

- Try to order the documentation sections in the order that makes it easiest for the user to follow. That is, order the sections in the same order as the actual workflow used to accomplish the task.

- When writng procedural documentation (How Tos) try to follow the workflow in the UI, presenting the exact page(s) they need to navigate, and then the exact fields, tabs, etc that they need to select or fill out. Present the UI components in the document in the same order they appear in the UI.

- Use headings (sub-titles) to break up long documents, and make it easier to find a specific section.

- Add cross-reference links to related content whenever possible.

- You can use standard [Docusaurus-specific features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features), which include MDX elements such as tabs and admonitions.

## Look and feel of the docs

In general, the visual, "aesthetics" of the technical documentation is intended to be "lean and clean". Both the content (shorter sentences, concise instructions, etc) and the layout strive to have a clean, uncluttered look, with restrained use of colors and large call0outs or announcements. Relatedly, the colors used for our Info and Warning callouts, light blue and light yellow respectively, are reserved for those purposes only.

## Terminology

### authentik names

- The product name authentik should always start with a lower-case "a" and end with a "k". Even if it is the first word in a sentence. :-)

- Our company name is Authentik Security, Inc. but in non-legal documentation you can shorten it to Authentik Security.

### Industry terms, technology, and other tools

- When referring to external tools, or an industry term or technology, always follow the exact capitalization that the product or company itself uses on their website, in their official documentation, or what the industry uses in consensus.

- Try to avoid using abbreviations if possible.

- Use acronyms where it makes sense (for commonly used terms like SAML or RBAC). If an acronym is less-known, spell it out in parentheses after the first use.

## Writing style

- authentik documentation strives for a friendly, but not overly so, tone. It's ok to be a little bit conversational, and to address the reader in second person: "Next, you need to configure the log in settings."

- Our documentation uses American English ("z" not "s").

- Use the present tense and active voice in almost all cases:

    - DON'T: "The Applications page will be loaded."

    - DO: "The Applications page displays."

- Phrasing should never blame the user, and should be subjective:

    - DON'T: "Never modify the default file."

    - DO: "We recommend that you do not modify the default file, because this can result in unexpected issues."

## Formatting

Formatting in documentation is important; it improves comprehension and readability, and allows the brain to more quickly determine what is a command or a configuration setting, what is a field name, or what is a variable.

### Fonts and font styling

- When referring to UI elements or components in the authentik UI, such as field names, labels, etc., use **bold** text.

- When referring to internal components in authentik, like the policy engine, or blueprints, do not use any special formatting. Link to the relevant documentation when possible.

- Use `code` format when referring to:

    - commands
    - file paths
    - file names
    - directory names
    - code snippets (single line or a block of code)

- Use _italic_ font for variables or placeholders to make it clear they need to be replaced. Choose placeholder names that highlight their purpose, ensuring users understand what to update.

- When handling URLs:

    - For URLs entered as values or defined in fields, apply `code formatting` and _italicize_ any variables within them to emphasize that placeholders require user input. Example: `<kbd>https://<em>company-domain</em>/source/oauth/callback/<em>source-slug</em></kbd>`.
    - When mentioning URLs in text or within procedural instructions, omit code formatting. For instance: "In your browser, go to https://example.com."

    Clearly indicate whether variables in code snippets need to be defined by the user, are system-provided, or generated.

- When referring to authentik functionality and features, such as flows, stages, sources, or policies, do not capitalize and do not use bold or italic text. When possible link to the corresponding documentation.

### Titles and headers

- Both titles and headers (H1, H2, H3) use sentence style capitalization, meaning that only the first word is capitalized. However, if the title or header includes a proper noun (name of a product, etc) then capitalize those words.
  Examples:

    - Configure your provider
    - Configure the Google Workspace provider

- Make sure the title/header is descriptive, and tells the reader what that section is about. Try to avoid titles or headers like "Overview". Instead say "About authentik policies".

- Use the imperative verb form (not the gerund form) for procedural topics. For example, use "Configure your instance" instead of "Configuring your instance".

### Examples

When you want to show an example (say, a code snippet), use a new line, bold text, and a semi-colon, like this:

    **Example**:
    This expression policy uses an expression based on the user's name.
    ```
    if request.context["pending_user"].username == "marie":
      return True
    return False
    ```

### Notes and warnings

Use the following convention for a note:

```
:::info
Write your note here.
:::
```

:::info
Write your note here.
:::

For a warning, use this:

```
:::warning
Write your note here.
:::
```

:::warning
Write your warning here.
:::

```

```

## Word choices

- **May** versus **might** versus **can**
  Typically, the word "may" is not used in technical writing, because it implies permission (rather than ability) to do something. Instead use the word "can". Use "might" when the scenario could be different in certain environments. Be sparing with your use of "might"; this word implies unpredictability, not our favorite thing with software.

    - DON'T: "You may use an Expression policy to enforce MFA adherence."

    - DO: "You can use an Expression policy to enforce MFA adherence."

    - Do: "Values might differ depending on the source of the property mappings.""

- **Login**, **log in**, and **log in to**
  As a descriptive term, use one word: "login". (The login panel.)
  As a verb, use "log in", with two words. (This stage prompts the user to log in.)
  As a verb with the proposition "to", use "log in to". (Log in to the application.)
