**How to use this template**: start with the markdown version of the template, either by copying the [`combo.tmpl.md`](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/tree/main/website/developer-docs/docs/templates) file from our GitHub repo or downloading the template file using the following command:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goauthentik/authentik/main/website/developer-docs/docs/templates/combo.tmpl.md
```

Edit your markdown file as you work, reading this page for the descriptions of each section. You can build out a "stub file" with just headers, then gradually add content to each section. Use screenshots sparingly, only for complex UIs where it is difficult to describe a UI element with words. Refer to our [Style Guide](../style-guide.mdx) for writing tips and authentik-specific rules.

For a combo topic, the title is typically the name of the feature ("Branding" or "Remote Access Control").

In this first section, right after the title but with no header, write one or two sentences about the task. Keep it brief, just an overview.

## About feature XYZ

In this section, go into a deeper explanation of the feature, provide typical use cases, etc.

### More info about the feature, a sub-category of info

Use this section if there are several big topics or categories of info that the reader needs to know about the feature or task. Add as many of these sections as needed.

## Prerequisites (optional section)

In this section, inform the reader of anything they need to do, or have configured or installed, before they start following the procedural instructions below.

## Overview of steps/workflow (optional section)

If the task is quite long or complex, it might be good to add a bullet list of the main steps, or even a diagram of the workflow, just so that the reader can first familiarize themselves with the 50,000 meter view before they dive into the detailed steps.

## First several group steps

If the task involves a lot of steps, try to group them into similar steps and have a Head3 or Head4 title for each group.

In this section, help the reader get oriented... where do they need to be (i.e. in the GUI, on a CLI, etc).

Have a separate paragraph for each step.

_Start instructions with the desired goal_, followed by the instructions. For example, in this sentence: "To define a new port number, navigate to the Admin interface, and then to the **Settings** tab." we first read the goal (to define a new port) and then we see the instructions.

## Next step of grouped steps (if a second group is needed)

Continue with the steps...

Use screenshots sparingly, only for complex UIs where it is difficult to describe a UI element with words.

Provide as many code snippets and examples as needed.

## Verify the steps

Use a heading such as "Verify your installation" or "Verify successful configuration". Whenever possible, it is useful to add verification steps at the end of a procedural topic. For example, if the procedural was about installing a product, use this section to tell them how they can verify that the install was successful.
