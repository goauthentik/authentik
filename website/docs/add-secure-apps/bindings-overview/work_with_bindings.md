title: Work with bindings
---

As covered in the [overview](./index.md), bindings interact with many other components.

For instructions to create a binding, refer to the documentation for the specific components:

- [Bind a stage to a flow](../flows-stages/stages/index.md#bind-a-stage-to-a-flow)
- [Bind a policy to a flow, stage, application, or source](../../customize/policies/working_with_policies.md#bind-a-policy-to-a-flow-stage-application-or-source)
- [Bind users or groups to a specific application](../applications/manage_apps.mdx#use-bindings-to-control-access)
- [Bind a policy to a specific application when you create a new application and provider](../applications/manage_apps.mdx#create-an-application-and-provider-pair)
- [Bind users and groups to a stage binding, to define whether or not that stage is shown](../flows-stages/stages/index.md#bind-users-and-groups-to-a-flows-stage-binding)
