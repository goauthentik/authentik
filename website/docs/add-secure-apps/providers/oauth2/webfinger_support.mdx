## About WebFinger

The [WebFinger protocol](https://webfinger.net/) allows for the discovery of information about individuals or entities on the Internet through standard HTTP methods. It enables the retrieval of information associated with a URI that might not be directly usable as a locator, such as those for accounts or email addresses.

## authentik WebFinger support

authentik provides a WebFinger endpoint when the **Default application** setting uses an OIDC provider. Instructions on how to set a **Default application** can be found in the [authentik Branding documentation](../../../sys-mgmt/brands.md#external-user-settings).

The WebFinger endpoint is available at: `https://authentik.company/.well-known/webfinger` (where authentik.company is the FQDN of your authentik instance)
