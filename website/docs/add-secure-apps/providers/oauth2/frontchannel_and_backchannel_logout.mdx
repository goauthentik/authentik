## Overview

OAuth2/OIDC logout is a security feature defined in the OpenID Connect specification. It allows an OIDC Provider (OP), such as authentik, to notify Relying Parties (RPs) when a user session ends. This ensures that all associated applications can properly terminate the user's session.

For more information about single logout across all providers, see the [Single Logout (SLO) Overview](../single-logout/index.md).

:::warning
Your OAuth application (Relying Party) must explicitly support OpenID Connect front-channel logout or back-channel logout to properly handle logout requests. Not all OAuth applications support these features, so compatibility should be verified.
:::

## Requirements

Your OAuth application (Relying Party) must:

    - **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production.
    - **Accessible**: Be reachable from authentik.
    - **Logout endpoint**: Have a defined endpoint to handle OP logout requests (front-channel, back-channel, or both).

## Configuration

### Set up single logout

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Providers**.
3. Edit or create an OAuth2 provider.
4. In the **Logout URI** field, enter the logout endpoint provided by your RP, if supported.
5. Select the **Logout Method** to choose **Front-channel** or **Back-channel** based on RP support.
6. Click **Finish** to save your changes.

:::info
Back-channel logout is the only way to ensure that users are logged out of the provider when their session is administratively terminated (e.g., when a user is deactivated or their session is deleted).
:::

### Logout URI format

The **Logout URI** should be a single URL provided by your Relying Party application, for example:

#### Back-channel

```
https://app.example.com/oauth/backchannel-logout
https://api.service.com/logout/backchannel
https://client.example.org/backchannel-logout
```

#### Front-channel

```
https://app.example.com/oauth/logout
https://api.service.com/logout
```

## How OpenID Connect single logout works

### Back-channel logout

With back-channel logout, authentik sends logout requests directly from the server to the RPâ€™s logout endpoint via HTTP POST. The logout request includes a signed JWT logout token that contains the following JWT claims:

    - `iss` (issuer): The authentik issuer URL
    - `sub` (subject): The user's unique identifier
    - `aud` (audience): The client ID
    - `iat` (issued at): Token creation timestamp
    - `jti` (JWT ID): Unique token identifier
    - `events`: Logout event claim
    - `sid` (session ID): The session identifier (if available)

Example back-channel logout request:

```http
POST /backchannel-logout HTTP/1.1
Host: client.example.org
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

logout_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

Back-channel logout is triggered when:

    - A user logs out through a logout flow
    - An administrator deletes a user's session
    - A user account is deactivated
    - A session expires or is revoked

### Front-channel logout

With front-channel logout, authentik injects an iframe logout stage into the logout flow. This stage loads the RP's (relying party) front-channel logout URL in a hidden iframe within the user's browser. The logout URL includes session information as query parameters, such as:

    - `iss`: The authentik issuer URL
    - `sid`: The session identifier

Example front-channel logout iframe:

```html
<iframe
    src="https://app.example.com/oauth/logout?iss=https://authentik.company&sid=session_id"
></iframe>
```

The RP processes the logout request and terminates the user's session. After all iframes complete their requests, the user continues through the authentik logout flow.

:::info
Front-channel logout only works for user-initiated logouts through a logout flow. It cannot be used for administrative session termination since it requires an active browser session.
