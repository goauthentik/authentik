## Overview

Back-channel logout is a security feature defined in the [OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0 specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html). It allow an OpenID Provider (OP), such as authentik, to notify Relying Parties (RPs) when a user session ends. This ensures that all associated applications can properly terminate the user's session, even without direct user interaction.

:::warning
Your OAuth application (Relying Party) must explicitly support the OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0 specification to properly handle back-channel logout requests. Not all OAuth applications support this feature, so compatibility should be verified.

## How back-channel logout works

When a user logs out _or_ their session is otherwise terminated in authentik, the following events occur:

1. **Session Termination**: The user's session is ended through the logout flow, an administrative action, or token revocation.
2. **Provider Notification**: authentik identifies all OAuth2 providers with active sessions for the user.
3. **Back-Channel Request**: HTTP POST requests are sent to each provider's configured back-channel logout URI.
4. **RP Processing**: Each Relying Party processes the request, validates the logout token, and terminates the user's local session.

## Requirements

Your OAuth application (Relying Party) must:

    - **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production.
    - **Accessible**: Be reachable from authentik.
    - **POST Support**: Accept POST requests with form data.

## Configuration

### Set up back-channel logout

1. In the Admin interface, navigate to **Applications** > **Providers**.
2. Edit or [create an OAuth2 provider](./create-oauth2-provider.md).
3. Enter the back-channel logout endpoint URL provided by your Relying Party in the **Back-channel Logout URI** field.

### Back-channel logout URI format

The back-channel logout URI should be a **single URL** provided by your Relying Party application. Examples:

- `https://app.example.com/oauth/backchannel-logout`
- `https://api.service.com/logout/backchannel`
- `https://client.example.org/backchannel-logout`

## Logout token

The back-channel logout request includes a **logout token** as form data:

```http
POST /backchannel-logout HTTP/1.1
Host: client.example.org
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

logout_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```
