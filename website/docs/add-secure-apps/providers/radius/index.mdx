import { HashSupport } from "./HashSupport";

You can configure a Radius provider for applications that don't support any other protocols or that require Radius.

:::info
This provider requires the deployment of the [RADIUS outpost](../../outposts/index.mdx).
:::

Currently, only authentication requests are supported.

### Authentication flow

Authentication requests against the Radius Server use a flow in the background. This allows you to use the same flows, stages, and policies as you do for web-based logins.

The following stages are supported:

    - [Identification](../../flows-stages/stages/identification/index.mdx)
    - [Password](../../flows-stages/stages/password/index.md)
    - [Authenticator validation](../../flows-stages/stages/authenticator_validate/index.mdx)

    :::info
    Authenticator validation currently only supports DUO, TOTP, and static auNothenticators.
    :::

    For code-based authenticators, the code must be given as part of the bind password, separated by a semicolon. For example for the password `example-password` and the MFA token `123456`, the input must be `example-password;123456`.

    SMS-based authenticators are not supported because they require a code to be sent from authentik, which is not possible during the bind.

- [User Logout](../../flows-stages/stages/user_logout.md)
- [User Login](../../flows-stages/stages/user_login/index.md)
- [Deny](../../flows-stages/stages/deny.md)
- [Mutual TLS stage](../../flows-stages/stages/mtls/index.md)

### EAP :ak-enterprise :ak-version[2025.10]

authentik supports EAP with TLS as the inner protocol, between the application and transport layers to encrypt and secure communications. To set this up, a certificate authority needs to be available and client certificates need to be installed on machines, the configuration of which is outside of the scope of this document.

#### EAP-TLS

Create an authentication flow with a [Mutual TLS stage](../../flows-stages/stages/mtls/index.md) as its first stage. This stage should be configured to use your certificate authority. Afterwards a certificate needs to be generated for the RADIUS outpost, which can be configured in the RADIUS provider. After the certificate and the authentication flow are configured in the provider, authentication via EAP-TLS is possible.

For certificates, we recommend using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to enable the EAP-TLS method. The PKI issues digital certificates to authenticate both the user and the server.

### RADIUS attributes

Starting with authentik 2024.8, you can create RADIUS provider property mappings, which make it possible to add custom attributes to the RADIUS response packets.

For example, to add the Cisco AV-Pair attribute, this snippet can be used:

```python
define_attribute(
    vendor_code=9,
    vendor_name="Cisco",
    attribute_name="AV-Pair",
    attribute_code=1,
    attribute_type="string",
)
packet["Cisco-AV-Pair"] = "shell:priv-lvl=15"
return packet
```

After creation, make sure to select the RADIUS property mapping in the RADIUS provider.

### Limitations

The RADIUS provider only supports the [PAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_Authentication_Protocol) (Password Authentication Protocol) protocol:
