## About RAC connection settings

The RAC provider utilises [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/) for establishing SSH, RDP and VNC connections. RAC supports the use of Apache Guacamole connection configurations.

For a full list of possible configurations, see the [Apache Guacamole connection configuration documentation](https://guacamole.apache.org/doc/gug/configuring-guacamole.html#configuring-connections).

RAC connection settings can be set via several methods:
    1. The settings of the RAC provider.
    2. RAC endpoint settings.
    3. RAC property mappings.
    4. Fetched from user or group attributes via RAC property mappings.

## How to apply an RAC connection setting

The [RAC SSH public key authentication](./rac-public-key.md) page has examples on how RAC connection settings can be applied.
