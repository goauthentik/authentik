title: Work with bindings
---

As covered in the [overview](./index.md), bindings interact with many other components.

For instructions to create a binding, refer to the documentation for the specific components:

- [Bind a stage to a flow](../stages/index.md#bind-a-stage-to-a-flow)
- [Bind a policy to a flow or stage](../../../customize/policies/working_with_policies/working_with_policies.md#bind-a-policy-to-a-flow-or-stage)
- [Create an Application Entitlement and bind users or Groups](../../applications/manage_apps.md#application-entitlements)
- [Bind users and groups to a stage binding](../stages/index.md#bind-users-and-groups-to-a-flows-stage-binding)
