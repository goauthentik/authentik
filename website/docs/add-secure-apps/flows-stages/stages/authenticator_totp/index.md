title: TOTP authenticator setup stage
---

This stage configures a time-based OTP Device, such as Google Authenticator or Authy.

You can configure how many digits should be used for the OTP Token.

The Config URL's Issuer is set based on the currently active brand's branding title. The default setup can cause issues if the same username is used on multiple authentik issues within the same authenticator app, so changing the brand title is recommended.
