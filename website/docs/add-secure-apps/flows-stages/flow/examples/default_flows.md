title: Default flows
---

When you create a new provider, you can select certain default flows that will be used with the provider and its associated application. For example, you can [create a custom flow](../index.md#create-a-custom-flow) that override the defaults configured on the brand.

If no default flow is selected when the provider is created, to determine which flow should be used authentik will first check if there is a default flow configured in the active [**Brand**](../../../../customize/brands.md). If no default is configured there, authentik will go through all flows with the matching designation, sorted by `slug` and evaluate policies bound directly to the flows, and the first flow whose policies allow access will be picked.

import DefaultFlowList from "../../flow/flow_list/\_defaultflowlist.mdx";
