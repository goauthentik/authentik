## Breaking changes

- Have I Been Pwned policy is deprecated

    The policy has been merged with the password policy which provides the same functionality. Existing Have I Been Pwned policies will automatically be migrated.

- Instead of using multiple redis databases, authentik now uses a single redis database

    This will temporarily loose some cached information after the upgrade, like cached system tasks and policy results. This data will be re-cached in the background.

## New features

- authentik now runs on Python 3.11
- Expanded password policy

    The "Have I been Pwned" policy has been merged into the password policy, and additionally passwords can be checked using [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) to provider concise feedback.

## Upgrading

This release does not introduce any new requirements.
