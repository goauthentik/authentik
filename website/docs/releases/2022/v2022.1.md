## Breaking changes

This release mostly removes legacy fields and features that have been deprecated for several releases.

-   LDAP Outposts:

    This release removes the `accountStatus` and `superuser` fields. Use the direct replacements `goauthentik.io/ldap/active` and `goauthentik.io/ldap/superuser`.

-   Proxy Outposts:

    This release consolidates headers sent by authentik to have a common prefix.

    The following headers have been removed:

    -   X-Auth-Username, use `X-authentik-username`
    -   X-Auth-Groups, use `X-authentik-groups`
    -   X-Forwarded-Email, use `X-authentik-email`
    -   X-Forwarded-Preferred-Username, use `X-authentik-username`
    -   X-Forwarded-User, use `X-authentik-uid`

    The proxy now also sets the host header based on what is configured as upstream in the proxy provider. The original Host is forwarded as `X-Forwarded-Host`.

    Additionally, the header requirements for nginx have changed. Either a `X-Original-URL` or `X-Original-URI` header are now required. See the [_Proxy provider_](../providers/proxy/forward_auth) documentation for updated snippets.

-   API:

    The deprecated /api/v2beta/ Endpoint is removed. Use `/api/v3/`.

-   Backup:

    The integrated backup has been deprecated for the following reasons:

    -   Difficulty with restores not working properly
    -   Inflexible configuration (fixed retention, limited to once a day, only S3 supported)
    -   Most users will already have an existing backup infrastructure
