## Breaking changes

- Prompt fields with file type are now a full Base64 Data-URI

    Previously the data was parsed into a string when possible, and when decoding failed, the raw base64 would be saved. Now, the entire URI is parsed, validated and kept in one piece, to make it possible to validate/save the MIME type.

## New features

- Blueprints

    Blueprints allow for the configuration, automation and templating of authentik objects and configurations. They can be used to bootstrap new instances, configure them automatically without external tools, and to template configurations for sharing. See more [here](../../customize/blueprints/index.mdx).

    For installations upgrading to 2022.8, if a single flow exists, then the default blueprints will not be activated, to not overwrite user modifications.

- Simplified forward auth

    In previous releases, to use forward auth, the reverse proxy would have to be configured to both send auth requests to the outpost, but also allow access to URLs starting with `/outpost.goauthentik.io`. The second part is now no longer required, with the exception of nginx. Existing setups should continue to function as previously.

- Support for Caddy forward auth

    Based on the traefik support, there is now dedicated support for Caddy with configuration examples, see [here](../../add-secure-apps/providers/proxy/forward_auth.mdx).
