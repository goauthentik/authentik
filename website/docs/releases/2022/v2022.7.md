## Breaking changes

- Removal of verification certificates for Machine-to-Machine authentication in OAuth 2 Provider

    Instead, create an OAuth Source with the certificate configured as JWKS Data, and enable the source in the provider.

- Maximum Limit of group recursion

    In earlier versions, cyclic group relations can lead to a deadlock when one of groups in the relationship are bound to an application/flow/etc.
    This is now limited to 20 levels of recursion.

- Change in context behaviour for policies executed within flows

    In previous versions, the policy context would be set to a reference to the currently active flow plan context. This makes it so any changes to `context` wre directly reflected in the flow context. The context has been changed to only include the values, and as such updates like this won't be reflected in the flow. Instead, `context['flow_plan']` is now set, which contains a full reference to the flow Plan, allowing for more customisability than previously. Context changes can be mad by modifying `context['flow_plan'].context`.

## New features

- User paths

    To better organize users, they can now be assigned a path. This allows for organization of users based on sources they enrolled with/got imported from, organizational structure or any other structure.

    Sources now have a path template to specify which path users created by it should be assigned. Additionally, you can set the path in the user_write stage in any flow, and it can be dynamically overwritten within a flow's context.

- API Authentication using JWT

    OAuth Refresh tokens that have been issued with the scope `goauthentik.io/api` can now be used to authenticate to the API on behalf of the user the token belongs to.

- Version-family tagged Container images

    Instead of having to choose between using the `:latest` tag and explicit versions like `:2022.7.1`, there are now also version-family tags (:2022.7). This allows for sticking with a single version but still getting bugfix updates.

- OAuth2 Provider default Scopes

    Starting with authentik 2022.7, when an OAuth client doesn't specify any scopes, authentik will treat the request as if all the configured scopes of that provider had been requested. Normal consent is still required depending on the configured flow. No special scopes will be added, as those can't be selected in the configuration.
