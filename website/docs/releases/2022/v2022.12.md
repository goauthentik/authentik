## Breaking changes

- Blueprints fetched via OCI require oci:// schema

    To better detect if a blueprint should be fetched locally or via OCI, all OCI sourced blueprints require an `oci://` protocol.

## New features

- Bundled GeoIP City database

    authentik now comes with a bundled MaxMind GeoLite2 City database. This allows everyone to take advantage of the extra data provided by GeoIP. The default docker-compose file removes the GeoIP update container as it is no longer needed. See more [here](../../sys-mgmt/ops/geoip.mdx).

- Improved UX for user & group management and stage/policy binding

    Users can now more easily be added to and removed from groups, both when viewing a single user and viewing a group.

    When creating new stages or policies, authentik will now automatically offer an option to bind them to the object in whose context they were created in.

    Select inputs were previously limited to showing a single page of items (default size of 100 items). These inputs have been replaced by dynamically loading inputs which support searching and better show the properties of the item.

- Preview for OAuth2 and SAML providers

    OAuth2 and SAML providers can now preview what the currently selected property/scope mappings's outcome will look like. This helps with seeing what data is sent to the client and implementing and testing custom mappings.

- Customisable Captcha stage

    The captcha stage now supports alternate compatible providers, like [hCaptcha](https://docs.hcaptcha.com/switch/) and [Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/migrating-from-recaptcha/).
