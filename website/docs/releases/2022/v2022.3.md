## New features

### Customizable user settings

User settings are now configured using flows and stages, allowing administrators to configure fields, add additional fields and run custom validation for user settings.

### `client_credentials` support

authentik now supports the OAuth `client_credentials` grant for machine-to-machine authentication. See [OAuth2 Provider](../../add-secure-apps/providers/oauth2/index.mdx)

## Deprecations

### `:stable` tag

To simplify the release process we don't publish explicitly tagged release-candidate versions anymore. With this change, the :latest tag will continue to point at the latest tagged release.
