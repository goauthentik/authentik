## Headline Changes

- Embedded Outpost

    To simplify the setup, an embedded outpost has been added. This outpost runs as part of the main authentik server, and requires no additional setup.

    You can simply assign providers to the embedded outpost, and either use the integrations to configure reverse proxies, or point your traffic to the main authentik server.
    Traffic is routed based on host-header, meaning every host that has been configured as a provider and is assigned to the embedded proxy will be sent to the outpost, and every sub-path under `/akprox` is sent to the outpost too. The rest is sent to authentik itself.


## Minor changes

- api: Add filters to resources which were missing them
