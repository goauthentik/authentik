title: Release 2025.2
slug: "/releases/2025.2"
---

## Highlights

- **SSF Provider <span class="badge badge--primary">Enterprise</span> <span class="badge badge--info">Preview</span>** Add support for Shared Signals Framework.
- **RAC moved open source** Remote access is now available to everyone!
- **GeoIP distance and impossible travel checks** Add the ability to check for the distance a user has moved compared to a previous login, and if the user could have travelled the distance.
- **Email OTP Stage** Allow users to use their email accounts as a one-time-password during authentication.
- **Fine-grained permission for superuser toggle on groups** Setting the **Is superuser** toggle on a group now requires a separate permission.

## Breaking changes

- **Fixed behaviour in Source stage <span class="badge badge--primary">Enterprise</span>**

    In previous versions, the Source stage would incorrectly continue with the initial flow after returning from the source, which didn't match the documented behaviour.

    With this release this behaviour has been corrected and the source stage will now correctly run the selected enrollment/authentication flow before returning to the flow the source stage was executed from.

- **Deprecated and frozen `:latest` container image tag after 2025.2**

    Using the `:latest` tag with container images is not recommended as it can lead to unintentional updates and potentially broken setups.

    The tag will not be removed, however it will also not be updated past 2025.2.

    We strongly recommended the use of a specific version tag for authentik instances' container images like `:2025.2`.

## New features

- **SSF Provider** <span class="badge badge--primary">Enterprise</span> <span class="badge badge--info">Preview</span>

    [Shared Signals Framework](../../add-secure-apps/providers/ssf/index.md) allows applications to register a stream with authentik within which they can received events from authentik such as when a session was revoked or a credential was add/changed/deleted and execute actions based on these events.

    Using a SSF provider as a backchannel provider allows admins to integrate authentik with Apple Business School Manager for federated Apple IDs.

- **RAC moved to open source**

    Remote access (RDP, VNC and SSH) has moved from enterprise to our free, open source code. We try our best to limit enterprise-specific functionality to features that would be non-essential to homelab users and far more valuable to enterprise use cases. We've had a variety of homelab users reach out with excellent use cases for RAC functionality, so while this will mean giving up some potential revenue, we think that opening up RAC to the community is the right thing to do!

- **GeoIP distance and impossible travel checks**

    Add the ability to check for the distance a user has moved compared to a previous login, and add the option to check impossible travel distances based on client IP.

    These options can be used to detect and prevent access from potentially stolen authentik sessions or stolen devices. Refer to our [documentation](../../customize/policies/index.md#geoip-policy).

- **Email OTP Authenticator Setup Stage**

    Admins now have the ability to configure the option for users to use their email address as an authenticator. Users that already have an email address set on their account will be able to use that address to receive one-time-passwords. It is also possible to configure authentik to allow users to add additional email addresses as authenticators.

    See [Email Authenticator Setup Stage](../../add-secure-apps/flows-stages/stages/authenticator_email/index.md).

- **Application Wizard is the default way to create applications**

    The default way of creating an application now allows admins to configure the application and provider at the same time, and also add any kind of bindings without having to navigate through different sections of the UI. The previous way of creating a standalone application is and will stay available alongside the new and streamlined method.

- **Fine-grained permission for superuser toggle on groups**

    Setting the **Is superuser** toggle on a group now requires a separate permission, making it much easier to allow for delegated management of groups without risking the ability for users to self-elevate permissions. For details, refer to our [documentation](../../users-sources/groups/manage_groups.mdx#modify-a-group).

- **Improved debugging experienc**e

    For people developing authentik or building very complex, custom integrations, how to configure debugging in authentik is documented [here](../../developer-docs/setup/debugging.md).

## Upgrading

This release does not introduce any new requirements. You can follow the upgrade instructions below; for more detailed information about upgrading authentik, refer to our [Upgrade documentation](../../install-config/upgrade.mdx).

:::warning
When you upgrade, be aware that the version of the authentik instance and of any outposts must be the same. We recommended that you always upgrade any outposts at the same time you upgrade your authentik instance.
:::

### Docker Compose

To upgrade, download the new docker-compose file and update the Docker stack with the new version, using these commands:

```shell
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://goauthentik.io/version/2025.2/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

The `-O` flag retains the downloaded file's name, overwriting any existing local file with the same name.

### Kubernetes

Upgrade the Helm Chart to the new version, using the following commands:

```shell
helm repo update
helm upgrade authentik authentik/authentik -f values.yaml --version ^2025.2
```
