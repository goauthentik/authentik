xxxx.x has not been released yet! We're publishing these release notes as a preview of what's to come, and for our awesome beta testers trying out release candidates.

To try out the release candidate, replace your Docker image tag with the latest release candidate number, such as xxxx.x.0-rc1. You can find the latest one in [the latest releases on GitHub](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/releases). If you don't find any, it means we haven't released one yet.

## Breaking changes

- **Docker image deprecation notice for `beryju/authentik` and `beryju/authentik-*`**

    The `beryju/authentik` and `beryju/authentik-*` image will stop being updated in a few releases. Users are now encouraged to use the following images:

    **Server image:**
    - `ghcr.io/goauthentik/server` or `authentik/server`

    **Outpost images:**
    - `ghcr.io/goauthentik/ldap` or `authentik/ldap`
    - `ghcr.io/goauthentik/proxy` or `authentik/proxy`
    - `ghcr.io/goauthentik/rac` or `authentik/rac`
    - `ghcr.io/goauthentik/radius` or `authentik/radius`

    We recommend updating your Docker Compose files or other container configurations to use these new image paths for consistency with our documentation.

## New features

## Upgrading

This release does not introduce any new requirements. You can follow the upgrade instructions below; for more detailed information about upgrading authentik, refer to our [Upgrade documentation](../../install-config/upgrade.mdx).

:::warning
When you upgrade, be aware that the version of the authentik instance and of any outposts must be the same. We recommended that you always upgrade any outposts at the same time you upgrade your authentik instance.
:::

### Docker Compose

To upgrade, download the new docker-compose file and update the Docker stack with the new version, using these commands:

```shell
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://goauthentik.io/version/xxxx.x/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

The `-O` flag retains the downloaded file's name, overwriting any existing local file with the same name.

### Kubernetes

Upgrade the Helm Chart to the new version, using the following commands:

```shell
helm repo update
helm upgrade authentik authentik/authentik -f values.yaml --version ^xxxx.x
```
