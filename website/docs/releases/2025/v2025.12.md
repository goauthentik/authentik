:::info
2025.12 has not been released yet! We're publishing these release notes as a preview of what's to come, and for our awesome beta testers trying out release candidates.

To try out the release candidate, replace your Docker image tag with the latest release candidate number, such as xxxx.x.0-rc1. You can find the latest one in [the latest releases on GitHub](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/releases). If you don't find any, it means we haven't released one yet.

## Highlights

- **Endpoint Devices**: Endpoint Devices is a new featureset for Windows, macOS, and Linux devices that enables SSH authentication, local device login, sudo authorization and more, all with authentik credentials.
- **CSV Data Exports**: Now you can export user and event data in CSV format for backup or analysis purposes.
- **RBAC Permissions**: Permissions are now granted exclusively via roles, and permission inheritance and basic object permssions have been enhanced.
- **Passkey Autofill (WebAuthN Conditional UI)**: WebAuthn Conditional UI (Passkey Autofill) is a seamless login feature to blend passkeys (passwordless credentials) into the existing login autofill dropdown, appearing alongside saved passwords when a user focuses on an input field. #TODOM

## Breaking changes

### Storage improvements

File storage has been reworked to unify media file configuration (icons, branding options), and allow future uses of file storage including [reports](#reports).

Files stored by authentik are now served from the `/files` prefix, and not from `/media` anymore. Any custom reverse proxy configuration handling those paths will need to be updated.

#### Storage mount changes

If local storage is used, authentik now expects a mount at `/data` for file storage. The existing `/media` mount must be moved to `/data/media`.

For Docker Compose users, the migration is as follows:

```shell
# Shut down authentik
docker compose down
# Create the new storage folder
mkdir -p ./data
# Move the old media storage to the new location
mv ./media ./data/media
# Download the new Docker Compose with the updated paths and start authentik. See below for details.
```

#### Storage configuration changes

New storage configuration options are available. See the [storage settings reference](../../install-config/configuration/configuration.mdx#storage-settings) for details.

## New features and improvements

### Endpoint devices

Endpoint Devices are end-user devices or servers authentication that are registered with authentik. #TODewi

Devices can be integrated by installing the [authentik Agent](./authentik-agent/index.mdx) which supports:

- [Local device login](./device-authentication/local-device-login/index.mdx) with authentik credentials
- [Connecting via SSH to Endpoint Devices](./device-authentication/ssh-authentication.mdx) with authentik credentials
- [Sudo authorization](./device-authentication/sudo-authorization.md) with authentik credentials
- [Authenticating to CLI applications](./device-authentication/cli-app-authentication/index.mdx) such as kubectl and AWS with authentik credentials

Alternatively, [Connectors](./device-compliance/connectors.md) allow authentik to be integrated with third party services like Fleet. This allows for device information to be reported to authentik for [Device Compliance](./device-compliance/index.mdx) purposes.

### UI Improvements on mobile and tablets devices

Flows are now responsive on smaller screen sizes (if you have custom styles you may need to revise them) #TODO

### Localization improvements

We have improved locale detection and updated our locale management to make future translations easier. Locale selector is now available on the login screen #TODO

### CSV Data Exports

You can export object data about users and events as a CSV file, search and view previous exports and their queries, and delete exports that you no longer need.

### RBAC Permissions

Our RBAC now focuses more strongly on the use of roles to grant permissions to users and groups. The 2025.12 release also provides support for multiple parents for a group, inherited permissions from ancestors, allowing one or MORE roles to be assigned to a single group, and enforcement of unique names for groups. Additionally, object permissions are auto-assigned to the object's creator via managed roles, to ensure CRUD rights.

### Files

### Promoted source

### Glossary

We have replaced our too-short Terminology page with a more rich [Glossary](../core/glossary/), with terms that are searchable by tags or first letter.

## Upgrading

This release does not introduce any new requirements. You can follow the upgrade instructions below; for more detailed information about upgrading authentik, refer to our [Upgrade documentation](../../install-config/upgrade.mdx).

:::warning
When you upgrade, be aware that the version of the authentik instance and of any outposts must be the same. We recommended that you always upgrade any outposts at the same time you upgrade your authentik instance.
:::

### Docker Compose

To upgrade, download the new docker-compose file and update the Docker stack with the new version, using these commands:

```shell
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://goauthentik.io/version/2025.12/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

The `-O` flag retains the downloaded file's name, overwriting any existing local file with the same name.

### Kubernetes

Upgrade the Helm Chart to the new version, using the following commands:

```shell
helm repo update
helm upgrade authentik authentik/authentik -f values.yaml --version ^xxxx.x
```
