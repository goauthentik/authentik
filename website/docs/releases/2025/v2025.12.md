:::info
2025.12 has not been released yet! We're publishing these release notes as a preview of what's to come, and for our awesome beta testers trying out release candidates.

To try out the release candidate, replace your Docker image tag with the latest release candidate number, such as xxxx.x.0-rc1. You can find the latest one in [the latest releases on GitHub](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/releases). If you don't find any, it means we haven't released one yet.

## Highlights

## Breaking changes

### Storage improvements

Files stored by authentik are now served from the `/files` prefix, and not from `/media` anymore.

#### Storage mount changes

If local storage is used, authentik now expects a mount at `/data` for file storage. The existing `/media` mount must be moved to `/data/media`.

For Docker Compose users, the migration is as follows:

```shell
# Shut down authentik
docker compose down
# Create the new storage folder
mkdir -p ./data
# Move the old media storage to the new location
mv ./media ./data/media
# Download the new Docker Compose with the updated paths and start authentik. See below for details.
```

#### Storage configuration changes

New storage configuration options are available. See the [storage settings reference](../../install-config/configuration/configuration.mdx#storage-settings) for details.

## New features and improvements

## Upgrading

This release does not introduce any new requirements. You can follow the upgrade instructions below; for more detailed information about upgrading authentik, refer to our [Upgrade documentation](../../install-config/upgrade.mdx).

:::warning
When you upgrade, be aware that the version of the authentik instance and of any outposts must be the same. We recommended that you always upgrade any outposts at the same time you upgrade your authentik instance.
:::

### Docker Compose

To upgrade, download the new docker-compose file and update the Docker stack with the new version, using these commands:

```shell
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://goauthentik.io/version/2025.12/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

The `-O` flag retains the downloaded file's name, overwriting any existing local file with the same name.

### Kubernetes

Upgrade the Helm Chart to the new version, using the following commands:

```shell
helm repo update
helm upgrade authentik authentik/authentik -f values.yaml --version ^xxxx.x
```
