:::info
2025.10 has not been released yet! We're publishing these release notes as a preview of what's to come, and for our awesome beta testers trying out release candidates.

To try out the release candidate, replace your Docker image tag with the latest release candidate number, such as 2025.10.0-rc1. You can find the latest one in [the latest releases on GitHub](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/releases). If you don't find any, it means we haven't released one yet.

## Highlights

- **Removed redis dependency**: authentik no longer uses redis at all.
- **SCIM provider OAuth support**: :ak-enterprise SCIM providers can use OAuth providers to authenticate to SCIM endpoints.
- **RADIUS EAP-TLS Support**: :ak-enterprise The RADIUS provider now supports EAP-TLS, which can be used to authenticate WiFi clients.
- **SAML and OIDC provider Single Logout support**: This release adds support for back-channel and front-channel SLO for SAML and front-channel for OIDC.
- **Telegram source**: Telegram can now be used for social login.

## Breaking changes

### Redis removal

In previous versions, authentik used Redis for caching, tasks, and WebSocket connections. Since [2025.8](./v2025.8.mdx), tasks were migrated to use Postgres. With this release we've also migrated caching and WebSocket to Postgres, fully removing the need for Redis.

As a result of this change, it is expected that authentik will use roughly xx% more database connections to Postgres. Redis-related settings have also been removed and can be deleted from your configuration.

If your Postgres instance requires a TLS connection, authentik now requires TLS 1.3 or the Extended Master Secret extension to connect to Postgres.

## New features and improvements

### SCIM provider OAuth support :ak-enterprise

SCIM providers can use OAuth providers to authenticate to SCIM endpoints. This requires support in the remote system for OAuth authentication, which for example Slack and Salesforce support.



## New integration guides

An integration is how authentik connects to third-party applications, directories, and other identity providers. The following integration guides were recently added.

- [Cloudflare](https://integrations.goauthentik.io/platforms/cloudflare/)
- [Termix](https://integrations.goauthentik.io/infrastructure/termix/)
- [Digital Ocean](https://integrations.goauthentik.io/cloud-providers/digitalocean/)
- [osTicket](https://integrations.goauthentik.io/infrastructure/osticket/)

## Upgrading

This release does not introduce any new requirements. You can follow the upgrade instructions below; for more detailed information about upgrading authentik, refer to our [Upgrade documentation](../install-config/upgrade.mdx).

:::warning
When you upgrade, be aware that the version of the authentik instance and of any outposts must be the same. We recommended that you always upgrade any outposts at the same time you upgrade your authentik instance.
:::

### Docker Compose

To upgrade, download the new docker-compose file and update the Docker stack with the new version, using these commands:

```shell
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://goauthentik.io/version/2025.10/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

The `-O` flag retains the downloaded file's name, overwriting any existing local file with the same name.

### Kubernetes

Upgrade the Helm Chart to the new version, using the following commands:

```shell
helm repo update
helm upgrade authentik authentik/authentik -f values.yaml --version ^2025.10
```
