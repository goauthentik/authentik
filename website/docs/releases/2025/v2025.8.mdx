:::::note
2025.8 has not been released yet! We're publishing these release notes as a preview of what's to come, and for our awesome beta testers trying out release candidates.

To try out the release candidate, replace your Docker image tag with the latest release candidate number, such as 2025.8.0-rc1. You can find the latest one in [the latest releases on GitHub](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/releases). If you don't find any, it means we haven't released one yet.
:::::

## Highlights

- **OAuth2/OpenID Connect back-channel logout**: :ak-preview A server-to-server notification mechanism that allows authentik to notify OAuth2/OpenID providers whenever a user's session is terminated.

- **Event map**: :ak-enterprise View geolocation of user events on a map.

![Screenshot of the admin interface showing events plotted on a histogram chart and on a map](../../sys-mgmt/events/event-map-chart.png)

- **Advanced search**: :ak-enterprise Search for users and events with custom query language to filter on their properties and attributes.

- **Email stage rate limiting**: The email stage can now be configured to set a maximum number of emails that can be sent within a specified time period.

## Breaking changes

### Worker and background tasks revamped

The authentik [worker](../../sys-mgmt/ops/worker.md) and [background tasks](../../sys-mgmt/background-tasks.md) have been reworked for better observability of tasks, and better configurability of scheduled tasks.

This rework also allowed us to not depend on Redis for background tasks. However, we replaced the engine used to manage these tasks, and as such, don't have a seamless migration path.

For instances with a high level of traffic, such as many users logging in, many sign up requests, etc., some tasks may be lost during the upgrade. Instances with low traffic can upgrade during periods of downtime.

To prevent losing tasks during the upgrade, instances with a high level of traffic should follow these instructions:

1. Start by upgrading the authentik server.
2. Inspect the old version task queue to check that all tasks are done. Execute the following commands in the not-yet-ugpraded worker container:

import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";

    <Tabs
    groupId="platform"
    defaultValue="docker-compose"
    values={[
        {label: 'docker-compose', value: 'docker-compose'},
        {label: 'Kubernetes', value: 'kubernetes'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="docker-compose">

    ```sh
    docker compose exec worker bash -c 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=authentik.root.settings celery -A authentik.root.celery inspect active'
    docker compose exec worker bash -c 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=authentik.root.settings celery -A authentik.root.celery inspect scheduled'
    docker compose exec worker bash -c 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=authentik.root.settings celery -A authentik.root.celery inspect reserved'
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kubernetes">

    ```sh
    kubectl exec -it deployment/authentik-worker -c worker -- bash -c 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=authentik.root.settings celery -A authentik.root.celery inspect active'
    kubectl exec -it deployment/authentik-worker -c worker -- bash -c 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=authentik.root.settings celery -A authentik.root.celery inspect scheduled'
    kubectl exec -it deployment/authentik-worker -c worker -- bash -c 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=authentik.root.settings celery -A authentik.root.celery inspect reserved'
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

3. Wait for all these commands to report the old task queues as "empty"
4. Finish by upgrading the worker

### Docker image deprecation notice for `beryju/authentik` and `beryju/authentik-*`

The `beryju/authentik` and `beryju/authentik-*` Docker images are no longer being updated. Users are now encouraged to use the following images:

- **Server image:**
    - `ghcr.io/goauthentik/server` or `authentik/server`

- **Outpost images:**
    - `ghcr.io/goauthentik/ldap` or `authentik/ldap`
    - `ghcr.io/goauthentik/proxy` or `authentik/proxy`
    - `ghcr.io/goauthentik/rac` or `authentik/rac`
    - `ghcr.io/goauthentik/radius` or `authentik/radius`

We recommend updating your Docker Compose files or other container configurations to use these new image paths.

### Database encoding requirements

The PostgreSQL database must now use the `UTF8` encoding. This is the default encoding that PostgreSQL uses. Unless you have specifically chosen a different encoding when creating the authentik database, no change is needed.

### Renamed/removed settings

The `AUTHENTIK_WORKER__CONCURRENCY` setting has been renamed `AUTHENTIK_WORKER__PROCESSES`. The old setting is still available as an alias and will be removed in a future release.

The following settings have been removed and no longer have an effect:

- `AUTHENTIK_BROKER__URL`
- `AUTHENTIK_BROKER__TRANSPORT_OPTIONS`
- `AUTHENTIK_RESULT_BACKEND__URL`

### Renamed/removed metrics

The `authentik_admin_workers` metric has been renamed `authentik_tasks_workers`.

The following metrics have been removed:

- `authentik_system_tasks`
- `authentik_system_tasks_time_seconds`
- `authentik_system_tasks_status`

Instead, the following metrics are now available:

- `authentik_tasks_total`
- `authentik_tasks_errors_total`
- `authentik_tasks_retries_total`
- `authentik_tasks_rejected_total`
- `authentik_tasks_in_progress`
- `authentik_tasks_delayed_in_progress`
- `authentik_tasks_duration_milliseconds`

## New features and improvements

- **LDAP Provider improvements**:
    - Group objects returned by queries to the LDAP provider now includes a `memberOf` field pointing back to its parent if set. Contributed by [@danieladugyan](https://github.com/danieladugyan), thank you!
    - LDAP connections are now terminated upon session deletion in authentik.

- **Accessibility improvements**: Better screen reader support within the admin interface for navigation, forms, and wizard elements.
- **Send event notifications to associated user**: Configure notification rules to send the event notification to the user associated to the event. Read more in our [notifications documentation](../../sys-mgmt/events/notifications.md).
- **Policy bindings performance improvements**: Policy bindings evaluation avoids forking new processes for user and group policy bindings.
- **SCIM Source patch support**: Add full patch support for all properties of users and groups.
- **Secret inputs in the admin interface are now hidden by default**.

## New integration guides

An integration is a how authentik connects to third-party applications, directories, and other identity providers. The following integration guides were recently added.

- [1Password](https://integrations.goauthentik.io/security/1password/)
- [Bitwarden](https://integrations.goauthentik.io/security/bitwarden/)
- [Papra](https://integrations.goauthentik.io/documentation/papra/)
- [Planka](https://integrations.goauthentik.io/chat-communication-collaboration/planka/)
- [Seafile](https://integrations.goauthentik.io/media/seafile/)
- [Zoho](https://integrations.goauthentik.io/platforms/zoho/)

## Upgrading

This release does not introduce any new requirements. You can follow the upgrade instructions below; for more detailed information about upgrading authentik, refer to our [Upgrade documentation](../../install-config/upgrade.mdx).

:::warning
When you upgrade, be aware that the version of the authentik instance and of any outposts must be the same. We recommended that you always upgrade any outposts at the same time you upgrade your authentik instance.
:::

### Docker Compose

To upgrade, download the new Docker Compose file and update the Docker stack with the new version, using these commands:

```shell
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://goauthentik.io/version/2025.8/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

The `-O` flag retains the downloaded file's name, overwriting any existing local file with the same name.

### Kubernetes

Upgrade the Helm Chart to the new version, using the following commands:

```shell
helm repo update
helm upgrade authentik authentik/authentik -f values.yaml --version ^2025.8
```
