title: Release 2023.2 - Signout and Avatar improvements
slug: "/releases/2023.2"
---

## New features

-   Proxy provider logout improvements

    In previous versions, logging out of a single proxied application would only invalidate that application's session. Starting with this release, when logging out of a proxied application (via the _/outpost.goauthentik.io/sign_out_ URL), all the users session within the outpost are terminated. Sessions in other outposts and with other protocols are unaffected.

    Additionally, different providers now have different cookies, instead of all using the same "authentik_proxy" token.

-   UX Improvements

    As with the previous improvements, we've made a lot of minor improvements to the general authentik UX to make your life easier.

-   OAuth2 Provider improvements

    The OAuth2 provider has been reworked to be closer to OAuth specifications and better support refresh tokens and offline access. Additionally the expiry for access tokens and refresh tokens can be adjusted separately now.

-   Generated avatars, multiple avatar modes

    authentik now supports multiple avatar modes, and will use the next configured mode when a mode doesn't have an avatar. For example, the new default configuration attempts to use gravatar, but if the user's email does not have a gravatar setup, it will instead use the new generated avatars. See [Configuration](../../installation/configuration.mdx#authentik_avatars)
