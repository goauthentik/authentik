## New features

-   Proxy provider logout improvements

    In previous versions, logging out of a single proxied application would only invalidate that application's session. Starting with this release, when logging out of a proxied application (via the _/outpost.goauthentik.io/sign_out_ URL), all the users session within the outpost are terminated. Sessions in other outposts and with other protocols are unaffected.

## Upgrading

This release does not introduce any new requirements.
