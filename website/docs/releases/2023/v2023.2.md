## New features

-   Proxy provider logout improvements

    In previous versions, logging out of a single proxied application would only invalidate that application's session. Starting with this release, when logging out of a proxied application (via the _/outpost.goauthentik.io/sign_out_ URL), all the users session within the outpost are terminated. Sessions in other outposts and with other protocols are unaffected.

-   UX Improvements

    As with the previous improvements, we've made a lot of minor improvements to the general authentik UX to make your life easier.

-   OAuth2 Provider improvements

    The OAuth2 provider has been reworked to be closer to OAuth specifications and better support refresh tokens and offline access. Additionally the expiry for access tokens and refresh tokens can be adjusted separately now.

## Upgrading

This release does not introduce any new requirements.
