## Breaking changes

-   Deprecation of PostgreSQL 11 support

    The next release of authentik will only support PostgreSQL 12 and newer. Upgrading can be done with https://github.com/tianon/docker-postgres-upgrade or by exporting the database and re-importing the database into a new PostgreSQL instance.

-   Removal of deprecated LDAP fields

    This version removes the deprecated LDAP fields `goauthentik.io/ldap/active` and `goauthentik.io/ldap/superuser`.

    Additionally, any custom fields based on user attributes will only be represented with their sanitized key, removing any slashes with dashes, and removing periods.

-   Renamed docker-compose environment variables

    To better distinguish settings that configure authentik itself and settings that configure docker-compose, the environment variables `AUTHENTIK_PORT_HTTP` and `AUTHENTIK_PORT_HTTPS` have been renamed to `COMPOSE_PORT_HTTP` and `COMPOSE_PORT_HTTPS` respectively.

## New features

-   Backchannel providers

    Backchannel providers can augment the functionality of applications by using additional protocols. The main provider of an application provides the SSO protocol that is used for logging into the application. Then, additional backchannel providers can be used for protocols such as [SCIM](../../providers/scim/index.md) and [LDAP](../../providers/ldap/index.md) to provide directory syncing.

    Access restrictions that are configured on an application apply to all of its backchannel providers.

-   Improved blueprint developer experience

    The blueprint schema has been greatly expanded to make writing blueprints easier. Where previously only possible models would be autocompleted, with the new schema all model fields are suggested with their types and possible values.

    Additionally, it is now possible to set Application and Source icons and Flow backgrounds via blueprints, by specifying their value as a URL.

## Upgrading

This release does not introduce any new requirements.

### docker-compose

To upgrade, download the new docker-compose file and update the Docker stack with the new version, using these commands:

```
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://goauthentik.io/version/2023.5/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```

The `-O` flag retains the downloaded file's name, overwriting any existing local file with the same name.

### Kubernetes

Update your values to use the new images:

```yaml
image:
    repository: ghcr.io/goauthentik/server
    tag: 2023.5.0
```
