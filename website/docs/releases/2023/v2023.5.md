## Breaking changes

-   Removal of deprecated LDAP fields

    This version removes the deprecated LDAP fields `goauthentik.io/ldap/active` and `goauthentik.io/ldap/superuser`.

    Additionally, any custom fields based on user attributes will only be represented with their sanitized key, removing any slashes with dashes, and removing periods.

-   Renamed docker-compose environment variables

    To better distinguish settings that configure authentik itself and settings that configure docker-compose, the environment variables `AUTHENTIK_PORT_HTTP` and `AUTHENTIK_PORT_HTTPS` have been renamed to `COMPOSE_PORT_HTTP` and `COMPOSE_PORT_HTTPS` respectively.
