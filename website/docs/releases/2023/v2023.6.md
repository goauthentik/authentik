<!-- ## Breaking changes -->

## New features

-   LDAP StartTLS support

    authentik's [LDAP Provider](../../providers/ldap/index.md) now supports StartTLS in addition to supporting SSL. The StartTLS is a more modern method of encrypting LDAP traffic. With this added support, the LDAP [Outpost](../../outposts/index.mdx) can now support multiple certificates.

## Upgrading

This release does not introduce any new requirements.

### docker-compose

To upgrade, download the new docker-compose file and update the Docker stack with the new version, using these commands:

```
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://goauthentik.io/version/2023.6/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```

The `-O` flag retains the downloaded file's name, overwriting any existing local file with the same name.

### Kubernetes

Update your values to use the new images:

```yaml
image:
    repository: ghcr.io/goauthentik/server
    tag: 2023.6.0
```
