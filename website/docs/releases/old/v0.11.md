This update brings these headline features:

-   Add Backup and Restore, currently only externally schedulable, documented [here](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/blob/version-2022.1/website/docs/maintenance/backups/index.md)
-   New Admin Dashboard with more metrics and Charts

    Shows successful and failed logins from the last 24 hours, as well as the most used applications

-   Add search to all table views
-   Outpost now supports a Docker Controller, which installs the Outpost on the same host as authentik, updates and manages it
-   Add Token Identifier

    Tokens now have an identifier which is used to reference to them, so the Primary key is not shown in URLs

-   `core/applications/list` API now shows applications the user has access to via policies

## Upgrading

This upgrade can be done as any other patch upgrade, the only external change is the new docker-compose file, which enabled the Docker Integration for Outposts. To use this feature, please download the latest docker-compose from [here](https://goauthentik.io/docker-compose.yml).

Afterwards, you can simply run `docker-compose up -d` and then the normal upgrade command of `docker-compose run --rm server migrate`.
