## Headline features

-   Flows are now graphically shown as diagrams, to visualise which stages and policies are bound.

    This diagram makes it significantly easier to understand how a flow works, as well as helping you design a flow that does exactly what you need.

-   Events now have a more general purpose, rather than just logging audit actions.

    The following new events are now logged:

    -   Policy Execution (Has to be enabled on a per-policy basis)
    -   Policy Exceptions
    -   Property Mapping Exceptions
    -   Configuration Errors (currently these events are created by incorrectly configured providers, but will be used further in the future.)
    -   Update availability

-   The OAuth2 Provider has been updated to closer match the OpenID Connect Specifications

    Response type no longer has to be configured manually. The issuer field can be configured now (the default behaviour is the same as pre-0.14)

    Authorization Codes are now generated as a JWT Token, which is not specified as spec, but seems to be a quasi-standard.

-   SAML Providers can now be created from SAML Metadata
-   The authentik proxy is now using the currently latest version of oauth2_proxy (6.1.1)
-   The license has been changed to GNU/GPL 3.0
