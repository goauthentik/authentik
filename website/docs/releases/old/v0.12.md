This update brings these headline features:

- Add System Task Overview to see all background tasks, their status, the log output, and retry them
- Alerts now disappear automatically
- Audit Logs are now searchable
- Users can now create their own Tokens to access the API
- docker-compose deployment now uses traefik 2.3

Fixes:

- Fix high CPU Usage of the proxy when Websocket connections fail

## Upgrading

### docker-compose

Docker-compose users should download the latest docker-compose file from [here](https://goauthentik.io/docker-compose.yml). This includes the new traefik 2.3.

Afterwards, you can simply run `docker-compose up -d` and then the normal upgrade command of `docker-compose run --rm server migrate`.

### Kubernetes

For Kubernetes users, there are some changes to the helm values.

The values change from

```yaml
config:
    # Optionally specify fixed secret_key, otherwise generated automatically
    # secret_key: _k*@6h2u2@q-dku57hhgzb7tnx*ba9wodcb^s9g0j59@=y(@_o
    # Enable error reporting
    error_reporting:
        enabled: false
        environment: customer
        send_pii: false
    # Log level used by web and worker
    # Can be either debug, info, warning, error
    log_level: warning
```

to

```yaml
config:
    # Optionally specify fixed secret_key, otherwise generated automatically
    # secretKey: _k*@6h2u2@q-dku57hhgzb7tnx*ba9wodcb^s9g0j59@=y(@_o
    # Enable error reporting
    errorReporting:
        enabled: false
        environment: customer
        sendPii: false
    # Log level used by web and worker
    # Can be either debug, info, warning, error
    logLevel: warning
```

in order to be consistent with the rest of the settings.

There is also a new setting called `kubernetesIntegration`, which controls the Kubernetes integration for authentik. When enabled (the default), a Service Account is created, which allows authentik to deploy and update Outposts.
