:::::note
2024.12 has not been released yet! We're publishing these release notes as a preview of what's to come, and for our awesome beta testers trying out release candidates.

To try out the release candidate, replace your Docker image tag with the latest release candidate number, such as 2024.12.0-rc1. You can find the latest one in [the latest releases on GitHub](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/releases). If you don't find any, it means we haven't released one yet.

## Highlights

- **Redirect stage** Conditionally redirect users to other flows and URLs.
- **Application entitlements** <span class="badge badge--info">Preview</span> Additional granular permission configuration on an application-level basis.
- **CloudFormation** <span class="badge badge--info">Preview</span> One-click deploy on AWS.
- **Policies in the application wizard** Configure access restriction while creating an application.

<!-- ## Breaking changes -->

## Breaking changes

- **Impersonation now requires providing a reason**

    You can disable this behavior in the **Admin interface** under **System** > **Settings**.

## New features

- **Redirect stage**

    This new stage allows redirecting a user to another flow or external URL. This allows for dynamically choosing which flow runs depending on user attributes or other factors, or redirection to another URL.

- **Application entitlements** <span class="badge badge--info">Preview</span>

    Centrally configure permissions by granting entitlements to groups and users on an application-level basis.

- **Policies in the application wizard**

    In the application creation wizard, administrators can now configure policies bindings along with the other application settings.

- **CloudFormation** <span class="badge badge--info">Preview</span>

    Deploy authentik in your own AWS environment with one click using our new [AWS CloudFormation template](../../install-config/install/aws/index.md).

- **OAuth2 provider federation**

    Configure [OAuth2 provider federation](../../add-secure-apps/providers/oauth2/client_credentials.md#authentik-issued-jwts-authentik-202412) to allow exchanging authentication tokens between multiple providers.

- **Silent authorization flow**

    When authorization flows don't require user interaction, authentik redirects the user directly back to the application, improving user experience.

## Upgrading

This release does not introduce any new requirements. You can follow the upgrade instructions below; for more detailed information about upgrading authentik, refer to our [Upgrade documentation](../../install-config/upgrade.mdx).

:::warning
When you upgrade, be aware that the version of the authentik instance and of any outposts must be the same. We recommended that you always upgrade any outposts at the same time you upgrade your authentik instance.
:::

### Docker Compose

To upgrade, download the new docker-compose file and update the Docker stack with the new version, using these commands:

```shell
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://goauthentik.io/version/2024.12/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

The `-O` flag retains the downloaded file's name, overwriting any existing local file with the same name.

### Kubernetes

Upgrade the Helm Chart to the new version, using the following commands:

```shell
helm repo update
helm upgrade authentik authentik/authentik -f values.yaml --version ^2024.12
```
