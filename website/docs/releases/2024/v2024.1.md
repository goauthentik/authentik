## Breaking changes

-   Removal of deprecated metrics

    -   `authentik_outpost_flow_timing_get` -> `authentik_outpost_flow_timing_get_seconds`
    -   `authentik_outpost_flow_timing_post` -> `authentik_outpost_flow_timing_post_seconds`
    -   `authentik_outpost_ldap_requests` -> `authentik_outpost_ldap_request_duration_seconds`
    -   `authentik_outpost_ldap_requests_rejected` -> `authentik_outpost_ldap_requests_rejected_total`
    -   `authentik_outpost_proxy_requests` -> `authentik_outpost_proxy_request_duration_seconds`
    -   `authentik_outpost_proxy_upstream_time` -> `authentik_outpost_proxy_upstream_response_duration_seconds`
    -   `authentik_outpost_radius_requests` -> `authentik_outpost_radius_request_duration_seconds`
    -   `authentik_outpost_radius_requests_rejected` -> `authentik_outpost_radius_requests_rejected_total`
    -   `authentik_main_requests` -> `authentik_main_request_duration_seconds`

-   Required `offline_access` scope for Refresh tokens

    The OAuth2 provider ships with a new default scope called `offline_access`, which must be requested by applications that need a refresh token. Previously, authentik would always issue a refresh token for the _Authorization code_ and _Device code_ OAuth grants.

    Applications which require will need their configuration update to include the `offline_access` scope mapping.

-   The Helm Chart has a number of breaking changes. Find out more in the [chart release notes](https://github.com/goauthentik/helm/releases/tag/authentik-2024.1.0).

## New features

-   "Pretend user exists" option for Identification stage

    Previously the identification stage would only continue if a user matching the user identifier exists. While this was the intended functionality, this release adds an option to continue to the next stage even if no matching user was found. "Pretend" users cannot authenticate nor receive emails, and don't exist in the database. **This feature is enabled by default.**

## Upgrading

This release does not introduce any new requirements.

### docker-compose

To upgrade, download the new docker-compose file and update the Docker stack with the new version, using these commands:

```
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://goauthentik.io/version/2024.1/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```

The `-O` flag retains the downloaded file's name, overwriting any existing local file with the same name.

### Kubernetes

Upgrade the Helm Chart to the new version, using the following commands:

```shell
helm repo update
helm upgrade authentik authentik/authentik -f values.yaml --version ^2024.1
```
