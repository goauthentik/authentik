## Highlights

- **Remote Access Control** <span class="badge badge--primary">Enterprise</span> Access machines over RDP, SSH, and VNC from authentik

- **Audit logging** <span class="badge badge--primary">Enterprise</span> See what fields were changed when objects are updated

- **Session location and network binding** Increase security by preventing session theft

- **Wizard to simplify creating applications and providers**

## Breaking changes

### Manual action is required

- **Tenants have been renamed to brands**

    Tenants, which were previously used to change branding configuration, default flows, and several other settings have been renamed to _brands_. The term "Brands" more accurately reflect their usage; to configure branding, logos, colors, and overall login flow behavior.

    Existing _tenant_ objects will automatically be renamed to _brand_ objects. The API endpoints associated with _brands_ have also been renamed.

    Blueprints using `authentik_tenants.tenant` will need to be changed to use `authentik_brands.brand`.

    For more information, refer to the [documentation for _brands_](../../sys-mgmt/brands.md).

    Also, **the event retention settings configured in brands (previously tenants, see above) has been removed and is now a system setting**, managed in the Admin interface or via the API (see below).

    **There is no built-in migration path for this change.** If you set something other than the default (`days=365`), you will need to update the setting in the admin interface.

- **Helm chart breaking changes**

    The Helm Chart has a number of breaking changes. Find out more in the [chart release notes](https://github.com/goauthentik/helm/releases/tag/authentik-2024.2.0).

### Manual action may be required

- **Required `offline_access` scope for Refresh tokens**

    The OAuth2 provider ships with a new default scope called `offline_access`, which must be requested by applications that need a refresh token. Previously, authentik would always issue a refresh token for the _Authorization code_ and _Device code_ OAuth grants.

    Applications that require a refresh token will need their configuration to be updated to include the `offline_access` scope mapping.

- **Database requirement changes**

    authentik now uses PostgreSQL schemas other than `public`.

    If you have a custom PostgreSQL deployment, please ensure that the authentik user is allowed to create schemas. Usually, if the authentik user is owner of the database, it already can.

- **Redis and cache configuration options have been improved**

    Thank you @PKizzle for this contribution!

    Cache settings have been moved from the `redis` top-level config key to their own `cache` top-level config key.

    Settings have also been added to configure the Redis instance/database used for tasks and websockets separately from cache. See [here](../../install-config/configuration/configuration.mdx#redis-settings).

    Typically, _no changes to the configuration are required_.

- **Configuration options migrated to the Admin interface**

    The following config options have been moved from the config file and can now be set using the Admin interface (under **System** -> **Settings**) or the API:

    - `AUTHENTIK_AVATARS`
    - `AUTHENTIK_DEFAULT_USER_CHANGE_NAME`
    - `AUTHENTIK_DEFAULT_USER_CHANGE_EMAIL`
    - `AUTHENTIK_DEFAULT_USER_CHANGE_USERNAME`
    - `AUTHENTIK_GDPR_COMPLIANCE`
    - `AUTHENTIK_IMPERSONATION`
    - `AUTHENTIK_FOOTER_LINKS`
    - `AUTHENTIK_REPUTATION__EXPIRY`

    When upgrading to 2024.2, the currently configured options will be automatically migrated to the database, and can be removed from the `.env` or helm values file afterwards.

- **Icons are now in a `public/` subfolder**

    If your media folder is `/media`, icons are now stored in `/media/public`. authentik will automatically migrate the icons upon upgrading.

    Note that even though that folder is named `public`, the files stored here are not automatically public. This is due to the naming of the default PostgreSQL schema.

- **User sessions will be invalidated after this upgrade.**

    As such, users will need to log back in. Immediately after the upgrade completes, users are logged out automatically and are then prompted to log in again. This only occurs once.

- **Removal of deprecated metrics**

    These metrics were renamed because they did not adhere to Prometheus best practices. The old metrics were kept for backwards compatibility and have now been removed.

    - `authentik_outpost_flow_timing_get` -> `authentik_outpost_flow_timing_get_seconds`
    - `authentik_outpost_flow_timing_post` -> `authentik_outpost_flow_timing_post_seconds`
    - `authentik_outpost_ldap_requests` -> `authentik_outpost_ldap_request_duration_seconds`
    - `authentik_outpost_ldap_requests_rejected` -> `authentik_outpost_ldap_requests_rejected_total`
    - `authentik_outpost_proxy_requests` -> `authentik_outpost_proxy_request_duration_seconds`
    - `authentik_outpost_proxy_upstream_time` -> `authentik_outpost_proxy_upstream_response_duration_seconds`
    - `authentik_outpost_radius_requests` -> `authentik_outpost_radius_request_duration_seconds`
    - `authentik_outpost_radius_requests_rejected` -> `authentik_outpost_radius_requests_rejected_total`
    - `authentik_main_requests` -> `authentik_main_request_duration_seconds`

- The shorthand parameter for `--stage`, `-s` for the `ak test_email` command has been changed to `-S`

## New features

- **New provider: Remote Access Control** <span class="badge badge--primary">Enterprise</span>

    The Remote Access Control provider allows you to remotely connect to remote machines over RDP, SSH and VNC through authentik. As such, you can use the same policy engine and customization options that are possible with other providers using the same user and admin interface.

- **Audit logging** <span class="badge badge--primary">Enterprise</span>

    authentik instances that have a valid enterprise license installed will log any changes made to models, including which fields were changed with previous and new values of the fields. The values are censored if they are sensitive (for example a password hash), however a hash of the changed value will still be logged.

- **Session location and network binding**

    Sessions for any users can now be bound to a specific geolocation (Continent, Country, City) or network (Autonomous System, subnet, IP address). If the session is accessed from a location/network that is different than that from which it was initially created, the session will be terminated.

    Configuration steps are available [here](../../add-secure-apps/flows-stages/stages/user_login/index.md#user-login-stage-configuration-options).

- **S3 file storage**

    Media files can now be stored on S3. Follow the [setup guide](../../sys-mgmt/ops/storage-s3.md) to get started.

- **_Pretend user exists_ option for Identification stage**

    Previously the Identification stage would only continue if a user matching the user identifier exists. While this was the intended functionality, this release adds an option to continue to the next stage even if no matching user was found. "Pretend" users cannot authenticate nor receive emails, and don't exist in the database.

    **This feature is enabled by default.**

### UX features

- **Simplified workflow for creating applications and providers**

    Applications and providers can now be created at the same time using the **Application Wizard**, found on the **Applications** -> **Applications** page of the Admin interface. The new wizard removes the previous requirement of first creating the provider, then the application, and then manually linking the two together.

- **Ability to select more than 20 providers in an outpost**

    We have introduced a new way of selecting providers in the outpost configuration form, which allows for more than 20 providers to be selected for a single outpost.

    This dual-list multiselect prompt is only available for outposts for now, but we plan on extending it to other forms.

- **Attribute preview per user**

    You can now preview attributes transmitted to SAML and OAuth applications for a specific user.

- **Display applications a user has access to**

    An administrator can now see all applications a user has access to on the user's page in the Admin interface.

### Other noteworthy features

- **New graph for event volume**

    In the **Events** -> **Log** page in the Admin interface, you can see a graph of the event volume matching the search query over the last 7 days.

- **Flows can now be restricted to outposts**

    You can now restrict a flow to be used only by an outpost using the **Require Outpost** setting on the flow. This would mainly be used for LDAP flows.

- **System tasks improvements**

    You can now search through system tasks. We have also improved the task duration calculation and display.

- **LDAP provider: allow overriding gidNumber**

    Previously, the `gidNumber` attribute on a user was set to the same as `uidNumber`. You can now override this behaviour.

- **LDAP source: new command to check connectivity**

    Examples on how to use are available [here](../../troubleshooting/ldap_source.md).

## Upgrading

This release does not introduce any new requirements, but contains some breaking changes, see above.

### docker-compose

To upgrade, download the new docker-compose file and update the Docker stack with the new version, using these commands:

```shell
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://goauthentik.io/version/2024.2/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

The `-O` flag retains the downloaded file's name, overwriting any existing local file with the same name.

### Kubernetes

Upgrade the Helm Chart to the new version, using the following commands:

```shell
helm repo update
helm upgrade authentik authentik/authentik -f values.yaml --version ^2024.2
```
