title: Release 2024.8
slug: "/releases/2024.8"
---

## Highlights

- **Source property mappings for SCIM, OAuth, SAML, and Plex sources**: All sources now support property mappings to configure how authentik interprets the incoming source's data. Additionally, groups can be synced from all sources that provide group info.
- **RADIUS provider custom attribute support**: Integrate RADIUS better into network infrastructure by sending vendor-specific attributes based on the user authenticating.
- **SAML encryption support**: SAML source and provider support encryption now, which prevents anyone from viewing the information of in-flight assertions.
- **RBAC support for blueprints and Terraform**: Permissions can now be assigned and automated using both blueprints and Terraform.

## Breaking changes

### Manual action is required

- **LDAP property mappings simplification**

    LDAP property mappings have been reworked to remove **Object field**. With this release, instead of returning a single user or group attribute for each property mapping, you can now return several of them. Here is an example of what new property mappings look like:

    ```python
    return {
        "username": ldap.get("uid"), # list_flatten is automatically applied to top-level attributes
        "attributes": {
            "phone": list_flatten(ldap.get("phoneNumber")), # but not for attributes!
        },
    }
    ```

    This property mapping populates the `username` and `attributes.phone` attributes of a user at the same time, reducing the number of mappings that are run and thus improving performance. Additionally, they are more straightforward to read, and this change allowed us to implement property mappings for OAuth and SAML sources as well.

    authentik will automatically convert existing property mappings to this new format, by generating some Python code for each of the existing property mappings expressions. Property mappings that are managed by authentik will automatically get updated to the new format.

    **If you have any custom property mappings, we recommend converting them to this new format.**

- **OAuth and SAML sources now sync groups by default**

    OAuth (specifically OpenID and Okta) sources now sync groups by default when a `groups` claim is available.

    SAML sources now sync groups by default when a `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/Group` attribute is available in the assertion.

    To disable that behavior, create an OAuth/SAML source property mapping with the expression below and assign it as a user property mapping on the source.

    ```python
    return {
        "groups": [],
    }
    ```

- **Terraform Resource rename**

    Several resources in the Terraform provider have been renamed to align with new functionality. This mainly applies to property mapping-related resources. With the authentik version 2024.8.1 of the Terraform provider, both the old and new resources are available, and resources can be moved to the new name using `terraform state mv`.

    These resources have been renamed:

    - `authentik_property_mapping_google_workspace`
    - `authentik_property_mapping_ldap`
    - `authentik_property_mapping_microsoft_entra`
    - `authentik_property_mapping_rac`
    - `authentik_property_mapping_radius`
    - `authentik_property_mapping_saml`
    - `authentik_property_mapping_scim`

### Manual action _may_ be required

- **Changes to the external user type**

    Since the introduction of user types with [2023.8](../2023/v2023.8.md), the main difference between internal and external users has mostly been relevant when using the [Enterprise](../../enterprise/index.md) version of authentik.

    With this release, authentik improves support for B2C use-cases, which external users are intended for. It is now possible to configure a default application. External users _not_ attempting to access a specific application will always be redirected to this default application.

    As part of this, external users will no longer have access to the User and Admin interfaces. If you're using the open-source version and you require this workflow, you can change users to be Internal, which will have no side-effects. For Enterprise customers, please reach out to us with any questions.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <details><summary>Bulk changing the user type</summary>In the container, run the command `ak change_user_type --all --type internal` to change all users to Internal. Instead of using `--all` you can also pass usernames to the command to only change individual users to internal.</details>

- **Changed HTTP healthcheck endpoints status code**

    For increased compatibility, the `/-/health/live/` and `/-/health/ready/` endpoints return 200 HTTP Status codes for successful checks. Previously these endpoints returned 204, which means in most cases no changes are required.

## New features

- **Source property mappings for SCIM, OAuth, SAML and Plex sources**

    All source types now support property mappings to customize how authentik should interpret the data the source provides. In addition to that, it is also now possible to sync groups and group membership from sources that provide group information. See [Property Mappings](../../users-sources/sources/property-mappings/index.md).

- **RADIUS provider custom attribute support**

    With 2024.8 it is possible to define custom attributes for the RADIUS provider, for example vendor-specific attributes like Cisco's `AV-Pair` attribute. These attributes are defined in property mappings which means they can be dynamically defined based on the user authenticating. See [RADIUS Provider](../../add-secure-apps/providers/radius/index.mdx#radius-attributes)

- **SAML encryption support**

    It is now possible to configure SAML sources and providers to decrypt and validate encrypted assertions. This can be configured by creating a [Certificate-keypair](../../sys-mgmt/certificates.md) and selecting it in the SAML source or provider.

- **GeoIP Policy**

    With the new [GeoIP Policy](../../customize/policies/index.md#geoip-policy) it is possible to grant/deny access based on Country and ASN, without having to write an expression policy.

- **Simplification of LDAP Provider permissions**

    The LDAP provider now uses RBAC to assign the appropriate permission to search the full directory instead of requiring a dedicated group to be created. As part of the upgrade, existing search groups' users are migrated to grant the required permission to search the full directory.

- **RBAC support for blueprints and Terraform**

    RBAC permissions for global/object level permissions for users/roles can now be managed via blueprints and Terraform. This allows for the automatic configuration of permissions.

- **UX improvements**

    In previous versions of authentik, there were several places in the Admin interface where you could not select more than 100 items. With this change, it is now possible to search for items and select more than 100 items.

- **WebFinger support**

    With the addition of the [default application](../../customize/brands.md#external-user-settings) setting, when the default application uses an OIDC provider, a WebFinger endpoint is available now.

## Upgrading

This release does not introduce any new requirements. You can follow the upgrade instructions below; for more detailed information about upgrading authentik, refer to our [Upgrade documentation](../../install-config/upgrade.mdx).

:::warning
When you upgrade, be aware that the version of the authentik instance and of any outposts must be the same. We recommended that you always upgrade any outposts at the same time you upgrade your authentik instance.
:::

### Docker Compose

To upgrade, download the new docker-compose file and update the Docker stack with the new version, using these commands:

```shell
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://goauthentik.io/version/2024.8/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

The `-O` flag retains the downloaded file's name, overwriting any existing local file with the same name.

### Kubernetes

Upgrade the Helm Chart to the new version, using the following commands:

```shell
helm repo update
helm upgrade authentik authentik/authentik -f values.yaml --version ^2024.8
```
