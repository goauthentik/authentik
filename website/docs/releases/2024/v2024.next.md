2024.next has not been released yet! We're publishing these release notes as a preview of what's to come, and for our awesome beta testers trying out release candidates.

To try out the release candidate, replace your Docker image tag with the latest release candidate number, such as 2024.next.0-rc1. You can find the latest one in [the latest releases on GitHub](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/releases). If you don't find any, it means we haven't released one yet.

The provided Helm chart defaults to PostgreSQL 15. If you are using the Helm chart with the default values, no action is required.

The provided Compose file was updated with PostgreSQL 16. You can follow the procedure [here](../../troubleshooting/postgres/upgrade_docker.md) to upgrade.

## New features

## Upgrading

authentik now requires PostgreSQL version 14 or later. We recommend upgrading to the latest version if needed. Follow the instructions [here](../../troubleshooting/postgres/upgrade_docker.md) if you need to upgrade PostgreSQL with docker-compose.

### Docker Compose

To upgrade, download the new Compose file and update the Docker stack with the new version, using these commands:

```shell
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://goauthentik.io/version/2024.next/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

The `-O` flag retains the downloaded file's name, overwriting any existing local file with the same name.

### Kubernetes

Upgrade the Helm Chart to the new version, using the following commands:

```shell
helm repo update
helm upgrade authentik authentik/authentik -f values.yaml --version ^2024.next
```
