## Breaking changes

## New features

-   LDAP Outpost cached binding

    Instead of always executing the configured flow when a new Bind request is received, the provider can now be configured to cache the session from the initial flow execution, and directly validate credentials in the outpost. This drastically improves the bind performance.

    See [LDAP provider](../providers/ldap.md#cached-bind)
