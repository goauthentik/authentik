## Breaking changes

-   Twitter Source has been migrated to OAuth2

    This requires some reconfiguration on both Twitter's and authentik's side. Check out the new Twitter integration docs [here](../../integrations/sources/twitter/)

## New features

-   LDAP Outpost cached binding

    Instead of always executing the configured flow when a new Bind request is received, the provider can now be configured to cache the session from the initial flow execution, and directly validate credentials in the outpost. This drastically improves the bind performance.

    See [LDAP provider](../providers/ldap.md#cached-bind)

-   OAuth2: Add support for `form_post` response mode
-   Optimise bundling of web asses

    Previous versions had the entire frontend bundled in a single file (per interface). This has been revamped to produce smaller bundle sizes for each interface to improve the loading times.

    Additionally, only the locales configured will be loaded on start, instead of all locales.

    Certain parts of the application are purposefully still contained in the initial bundle, especially for commonly used pages and default routes.
