## Breaking changes

-   Twitter Source has been migrated to OAuth2

    This requires some reconfiguration on both Twitter's and authentik's side. Check out the new Twitter integration docs [here](../../integrations/sources/twitter/)

-   OAuth Provider: Redirect URIs are now checked using regular expressions

    Allowed Redirect URIs now accepts regular expressions to check redirect URIs to support wildcards. In most cases this will not change anything, however casing is also important now. Meaning if your redirect URI is "https://Foo.bar" and allowed is "https://foo.bar", authorization will not be allowed. Additionally, the special handling when _Redirect URIs/Origins_ is set to `*` has been removed. To get the same behaviour, set _Redirect URIs/Origins_ to `.+`.

## New features

-   LDAP Outpost cached binding

    Instead of always executing the configured flow when a new Bind request is received, the provider can now be configured to cache the session from the initial flow execution, and directly validate credentials in the outpost. This drastically improves the bind performance.

    See [LDAP provider](../providers/ldap.md#cached-bind)

-   OAuth2: Add support for `form_post` response mode
-   Don't prompt users for MFA when they've authenticated themselves within a time period

    You can now configure any [Authenticator Validation Stage](../flow/stages/authenticator_validate/index.md) stage to not ask for MFA validation if the user has previously authenticated themselves with an MFA device (of any of the selected classes) in the `Last validation threshold`.

-   Optimise bundling of web assets

    Previous versions had the entire frontend bundled in a single file (per interface). This has been revamped to produce smaller bundle sizes for each interface to improve the loading times.

    Additionally, only the locales configured will be loaded on start, instead of all locales.

    Certain parts of the application are purposefully still contained in the initial bundle, especially for commonly used pages and default routes.
