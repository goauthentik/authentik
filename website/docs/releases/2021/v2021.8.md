## Headline Changes

-   Embedded Outpost

    To simplify the setup, an embedded outpost has been added. This outpost runs as part of the main authentik server, and requires no additional setup.

    You can simply assign providers to the embedded outpost, and either use the integrations to configure reverse proxies, or point your traffic to the main authentik server.
    Traffic is routed based on host-header, meaning every host that has been configured as a provider and is assigned to the embedded proxy will be sent to the outpost, and every sub-path under `/outpost.goauthentik.io` is sent to the outpost too. The rest is sent to authentik itself.

-   App passwords

    You can now create Tokens with the intent `app_password`, and use them when authenticating with a flow. This requires the `User database + app passwords` backend in your password stage (this is done automatically on upgrade).

    You will also see in the logs which backend was used as the `auth_method` and `auth_method_args` arguments on the Event.
