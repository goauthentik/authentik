## Headline Changes

- Flow Inspector

    To better understand how a flow works, and why things might not be working as intended, you can now launch Flows with an inspector enabled. This is simply triggered by adding a `?inspector` to the URL. Currently, only superuser have the permission to access the Inspector.

    The inspector shows the current stage, previous stages, next planned stages, and the current flow context.

- SMS Authenticator

    You can now use SMS-based TOTP authenticators. This new Stage supports both Twilio, and a generic API endpoint, if using another provider. This stage does not have to be used for authentication, it can simply be used during enrollment to verify your users phone numbers.

- Sign in with Apple

    It is now possible to add an Apple OAuth Source, to allow your users to authenticate with their Apple ID.

A huge shoutout to all the people that contributed, helped test and also translated authentik. This is the first release that has as full French translation!
