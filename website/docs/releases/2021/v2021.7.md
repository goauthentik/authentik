## Headline Changes

- SSL Support for LDAP Providers

    You can now configure certificates for your LDAP Providers, meaning that all communication will be done encrypted.

    Currently, only SSL on port 636 is supported, not StartTLS.

- Add bundled docs

    You can now browse the authentik docs for your version by browsing to `/help`. This means you don't have to rely on an
    internet connection to check the docs, and you also have the correct docs for your currently running version.
