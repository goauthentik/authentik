## Headline Changes

- Split user interface

    This release splits the administration interface from the end-user interface. This makes things clearer for end-users, as all their options are laid out more clearly.

    Additionally, the new end-user interface will be more customisable than the admin interface, allowing Administrators to configure what their users can see.

    The admin interface remains the same, and familiar buttons will redirect you between interfaces.

- New proxy

    The proxy outpost has been rewritten from scratch. This replaces the old proxy, which was based on oauth2_proxy. The new proxy allows us a much greater degree of flexibility, is much lighter and reports errors better.

    When using a managed outpost, authentik will automatically upgrade to the new proxy outpost. The embedded outpost also uses the new proxy.

    authentik also now deploys ServiceMonitor CRDs in your Kubernetes cluster (when possibly), to record the metrics of the outposts.

    If you're using a manually deployed outpost, keep in mind that the ports change to 9000 and 9443 instead of 4180 and 4443

- New metrics

    This version introduces new and simplified Prometheus metrics. There is a new common monitoring port across the server and all outposts, 9300. This port requires no authentication, making it easier to configure.

    For the core application, this endpoint contains metrics for both authentik and the inbuilt outpost.
