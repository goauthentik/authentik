## Headline Changes

- New versioning schema (year.month.release)
- Add global email settings

    In previous versions, you had to configure email connection details per [Email Stage](../../add-secure-apps/flows-stages/stages/email/index.mdx). Now, you can (and should) configure global settings.

    This is documented under the [docker-compose](../../install-config/install/docker-compose.mdx) and [Kubernetes](../../install-config/install/kubernetes.md) sections.

- New notification system

    More info can be found under [Notifications](../../sys-mgmt/events/notifications.md) and [Transports](../../sys-mgmt/events/transports.md).

    During the update, some default rules will be created. These rules notify you about policy exceptions, configuration errors and updates.

    These notifications will be sent using a default transport, which uses the global email transport.
