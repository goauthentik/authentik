## Breaking changes

-   Blueprints fetched via OCI require oci:// schema

    To better detect if a blueprint should be fetched locally or via OCI, all OCI sourced blueprints require an `oci://` protocol.

## New features

-   Bundled GeoIP City database

    authentik now comes with a bundled MaxMind GeoLite2 City database. This allows everyone to take advantage of the extra data provided by GeoIP. The default docker-compose file removes the GeoIP update container as it is no longer needed. See more [here](../core/geoip)

-   Customisable Captcha stage

    The captcha stage now supports alternate compatible providers, like [hCaptcha](https://docs.hcaptcha.com/switch/) and [Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/migrating-from-recaptcha/).

-   Preview for OAuth2 and SAML providers

    OAuth2 and SAML providers can now preview what the currently selected property/scope mappings's outcome will look like. This helps with seeing what data is sent to the client and implementing and testing custom mappings.

## Upgrading

This release does not introduce any new requirements.
