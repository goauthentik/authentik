title: Release 2021.1.2

## Headline Changes

- Managed objects

    Objects like property mappings can now be marked as managed, which means that they will be created, updated and deleted by authentik.

    Currently, this is used to update default property mappings, and mark tokens and users generated by outposts.

- Improved support for different LDAP Servers

    The LDAP source has improved support for non-Active Directory LDAP setups. This includes the following changes:

    - Switch to sync membership from groups to users rather than user to group
    - Fix users, which were removed from a group in LDAP not being removed from said group
    - Add support for LDAP servers which have core fields declared as lists
    - Add property-mappings for groups, to map attributes like `name` or `is_superuser`

- Add test view to debug property-mappings.

## Upgrading

This release does not introduce any new requirements.

Due to the switch to managed objects, some default property mappings are changing. This affects only the SAML Provider.

The change affects the "SAML Name" property, which has been changed from an oid to a Schema URI to aid readability.

The integrations affected are:
- [Ansible Tower/AWX](/docs/integrations/services/awx-tower/index)
- [GitLab](/docs/integrations/services/gitlab/index)
- [NextCloud](/docs/integrations/services/nextcloud/index)
- [Rancher](/docs/integrations/services/rancher/index)
- [Sentry](/docs/integrations/services/sentry/index)
