:::info
2026.2 has not been released yet! We're publishing these release notes as a preview of what's to come, and for our awesome beta testers trying out release candidates.

To try out the release candidate, replace your Docker image tag with the latest release candidate number, such as 2026.2.0-rc1. You can find the latest one in [the latest releases on GitHub](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/releases). If you don't find any, it means we haven't released one yet.

## Highlights

This release focuses on minor features and bugfixes. However, a couple of major enterprise features also made it in:

- **Object Lifecycle Management**: :ak-enterprise You can now automatically schedule periodic reviews of authentik objects (applications, groups, roles).
- **WS-Federation**: :ak-enterprise authentik now supports WS-Federation, a single sign-on and identity federation protocol.

### Release frequency change

In recent years a new authentik release was cut more-or-less every 2 months. We feel that our feature set is now mature enough to transition to a 3-month release cycle. The next release is therefore planned for May 2026.

In terms of security, we will keep to our current practice of supporting the two most recently released versions. The releases being further apart results in longer security coverage.

## Breaking changes

### RBAC

`User.ak_groups` has been deprecated. Users' groups are now accessed through `User.groups`. Usage of `.ak_groups` will continue to function, but will create a configuration warning event, at most every 30 days. We recommend you check any custom code (e.g. expression policies, property mappings) that deals with group memberships to update them if necessary.

### SCIM provider

Major improvements to the SCIM provider have been made by community contributions from @ImmanuelVonNeumann and @bitpavel-l25 in the form of [sync improvements](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/pull/13947) and [group imports](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/pull/19846). Thank you!

### Certificate builder

authentik's certificate builder now supports ED25519 and ED448 certificate generation.

- crypto: Add ED25519 and ED448 support to the certificate builder (#19465)

### Documentation page: First steps

- First steps docs page (#19217)

### πthon

authentik now uses [Python 3.14](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.14.html) under the hood. This means absolutely nothing as we use none of its features, but it has a cool name.

## Upgrading

This release does not introduce any new requirements. You can follow the upgrade instructions below; for more detailed information about upgrading authentik, refer to our [Upgrade documentation](../../install-config/upgrade.mdx).

:::warning
When you upgrade, be aware that the version of the authentik instance and of any outposts must be the same. We recommended that you always upgrade any outposts at the same time you upgrade your authentik instance.
:::

### Docker Compose

To upgrade, download the new docker-compose file and update the Docker stack with the new version, using these commands:

```shell
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://goauthentik.io/version/2026.2/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

The `-O` flag retains the downloaded file's name, overwriting any existing local file with the same name.

### Kubernetes

Upgrade the Helm Chart to the new version, using the following commands:

```shell
helm repo update
helm upgrade authentik authentik/authentik -f values.yaml --version ^2026.2
```
