## Breaking changes

- Removal of HTTP Basic authentication for API requests

  For legacy reasons, authentik used to support HTTP-Basic authenticated requests, using the token as a password. This has been removed.

## New features

- JWT authentication for `client_credentials` grants

  Providers can now be configured to accept JWTs signed by configured certificates, which makes it a lot easier to services access to authentik, when an existing machine/service identity is provided (for example, this can be used to let Kubernetes Pods authenticate themselves to authentik via their service account)
