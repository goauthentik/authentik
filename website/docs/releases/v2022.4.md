## Breaking changes

-   Removal of HTTP Basic authentication for API requests

    For legacy reasons, authentik used to support HTTP-Basic authenticated requests, using the token as a password. This has been removed.

-   Removal of deprecated context in Expression policies used in prompt stages

    Before this version, you could use both `context['*field_name*']` and `context['prompt_data']['*field_name*']`. The former one has been removed as it could overwrite other data in the context if the field name is the same as another context value.

-   Added name field for invitations

    Invitations now require a name, used to better identify their purpose.

## New features

-   Application Grouping

    Applications can now be grouped together to better organise connected applications in the user dashboard.

-   JWT authentication for `client_credentials` grants

    Providers can now be configured to accept JWTs signed by configured certificates, which makes it a lot easier to services access to authentik, when an existing machine/service identity is provided (for example, this can be used to let Kubernetes Pods authenticate themselves to authentik via their service account)
