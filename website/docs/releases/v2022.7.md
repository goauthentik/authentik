## Breaking changes

-   Removal of verification certificates for Machine-to-Machine authentication in OAuth 2 Provider

    Instead, create an OAuth Source with the certificate configured as JWKS Data, and enable the source in the provider.

-   Maximum Limit of group recursion

    In earlier versions, cyclic group relations can lead to a deadlock when one of groups in the relationship are bound to an application/flow/etc.
    This is now limited to 20 levels of recursion.

## New features

-   User paths

    To better organize users, they can now be assigned a path. This allows for organization of users based on sources they enrolled with/got imported from, organizational structure or any other structure.

    Sources now have a path template to specify which path users created by it should be assigned. Additionally, you can set the path in the user_write stage in any flow, and it can be dynamically overwritten within a flow's context.
