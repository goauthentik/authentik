title: Blueprints
---

Blueprints provide a way to template, automate, and distribute authentik configuration. Blueprints can be used to automatically configure instances, manage configurations-as-code without any external tools, and to distribute application configurations. Blueprints are YAML files, whose format is described further in [File structure](./v1/structure).

Blueprints are used to manage authentik default flows and other system objects. For example, authentik's `default-authentication-flow` is, under the covers, a blueprint.

Custom blueprint instances can be used to replace or modify default blueprints in certain circumstances. For example, you could modify the `default-authentication-flow` to change the layout of the login panel from the center to one side of the page.

## Types of blueprints

Blueprints can be applied in one of two ways:

- as a _Blueprint instance_
- as a _Flow import_

To _apply_ a blueprint means that the content in the blueprint file is initiated (as a blueprint instance) and used by authentik.

### Blueprint instance

- A Blueprint _instance_ is a YAML file mounted into the authentik (worker) container. This file is read and applied regularly (every 60 minutes). Multiple instances can be created for a single blueprint file, and instances can be given context key:value attributes to configure the blueprint.

    :::info
    authentik watches for file modification/creation events in the blueprint directory and will automatically trigger a discovery when a new blueprint instance file is created, and trigger a blueprint apply when a file is modified.
    :::

### Flow import

- A Flow import is a YAML file uploaded via the browser/API. This file is validated and applied directly after being uploaded, but is not further monitored and nor is it automatically applied on startup like blueprint instances.

:::
Be aware of how editing a flow impacts the related flow. For example, if you [modify and save](../../add-secure-apps/flows-stages/flow/#flow-configuration-options) an _existing default flow_, what you get is a merging of the two: the original flow (which is based on the blueprint) plus any changes you made to the flow. If you want to revert any modifications that you made to the default flow and get a fresh start with the original default flow, you have to 1.) _first_ delete the modified flow, and 2.) then create and apply the corollary default blueprint.

## Storage of bueprints

When you add a new blueprint instance, you can define where the `.yaml` file is stored.

### As a local file

The authentik container by default looks for blueprints in `/blueprints`. Underneath this directory, there are a couple of default subdirectories:

- `/blueprints/default`: Default blueprints for default flows, tenants, etc
- `/blueprints/example`: Example blueprints for common configurations and flows
- `/blueprints/system`: System blueprints for authentik managed Property mappings, etc

Any additional `.yaml` file in `/blueprints` will be discovered and automatically instantiated, depending on their labels.

To disable existing blueprints, an empty file can be mounted over the existing blueprint.

File-based blueprints are automatically removed once they become unavailable, however none of the objects created by those blueprints are affected by this.

:::info
Please note that, by default, blueprint discovery and evaluation is not guaranteed to follow any specific order.

If you have dependencies between blueprints, you should use [meta models](./v1/meta#authentik_blueprintsmetaapplyblueprint) to make sure that objects are created in the correct order.

### In an OCI registry

Blueprints can also be stored in remote [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) compliant registries. This includes GitHub Container Registry, Docker hub and many other registries.

To download a blueprint via OCI, set the path to `oci://ghcr.io/<username>/<package-name>:<ref>`. This will fetch the blueprint from an OCI package hosted on GHCR.

To fetch blueprints from a private registry with authentication, credentials can be embedded into the URL.

Blueprints are re-fetched each execution, so when using changing tags, blueprints will automatically be updated.

To push a blueprint to an OCI-compatible registry, [ORAS](https://oras.land/) can be used with this command

```
oras push ghcr.io/<username>/blueprint/<blueprint name>:latest <yaml file>:application/vnd.goauthentik.blueprint.v1+yaml
```

## Internally in authentik's database

Blueprints can be stored in authentik's database, which allows blueprints to be managed via external configuration management tools like Terraform.

Modifying the contents of a blueprint will trigger its reconciliation. Blueprints are validated on submission to prevent invalid blueprints from being saved.
