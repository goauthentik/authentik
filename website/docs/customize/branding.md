You can configure several differently "branded" options depending on the associated domain, even though objects such as applications, providers, etc, are still global. This can be handy to use the same authentik instance, but branded differently for different domains.

The main settings that control your instance's appearance and behaviour are the default flows and branding settings.

In the Admin interface, under **System** > **Brands**, create or modify a brand. For complete instructions refer to our [Brands documentation](../sys-mgmt/brands.md).
