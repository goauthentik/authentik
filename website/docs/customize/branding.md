You can configure several differently "branded" options depending on the associated domain, even though objects such as applications, providers, etc, are still global. This can be handy to use the same authentik instance, but branded differently for different domains.

The main settings that control your instance's appearance and behaviour are the [_branding settings_](../sys-mgmt/brands.md#branding-settings) and the the [_default flows_](../sys-mgmt/brands.md#default-flows). Review our tips for using images and icons in the [Image optimization](../sys-mgmt/brands.md#image-optimization) section.

The main settings that control your instance's appearance and behaviour are the **Branding settings** on your brand, and the default flows that you specify.

## Branding settings

The [_branding settings_](../sys-mgmt/brands.md#branding-settings) control the title, logo, favicon that are displayed in your authentik instance. Here you can also select a specific image as your default flow background image, meaning it will display as the background for all flows. Note that you can override this image on a per flow basis. You can also add custom CSS for the brand's pages.

Review our tips for using images and icons in the [Image optimization](../sys-mgmt/brands.md#image-optimization) section.

## Default flows

As another way to customize your authentik instance, you can specify the [_default flows_](../sys-mgmt/brands.md#default-flows) that you want authentik to use.
