You can configure several differently "branded" options depending on the associated domain, even though objects such as applications, providers, etc, are still global. This can be handy to use the same authentik instance, but branded differently for different domains.

The main settings that control your instance's appearance and behaviour are the [_branding settings_](../sys-mgmt/brands.md#branding-settings) and the the [_default flows_](../sys-mgmt/brands.md#default-flows). Review our tips for using images and icons in the [Image optimization](../sys-mgmt/brands.md#image-optimization) section.

To create or modify a brand, open the Admin interface and navigate to **System** > **Brands**. For complete instructions refer to our [Brands documentation](../sys-mgmt/brands.md).
