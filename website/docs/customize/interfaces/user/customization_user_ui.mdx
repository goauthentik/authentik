title: Customize the User and Admin interfaces
---

Both the authentik User interface and Admin interface can be customized using attributes configured in the [Brands](../../../sys-mgmt/brands.md) section, found under **Other global settings > Attributes**.

Most attributes defined in a Brand apply to _both_ the User and Admin interfaces. However, any settings that are specific to only one interface are explicitly noted as such below.

## Custom settings

The following settings are grouped by:

- `enabledFeatures` settings
- general settings (used on both the Admin interface and the User interface)
- User interface only

### Enabling/disabling features

The features listed below can be enabled or disabled through attributes set on the Brand. By default, all of the listed features are enabled. To disable a specific feature, set its value to `false`, as shown in the screenshot below.

import Enabledfeatureslist from "../\_enabledfeatureslist.mdx";

<Enabledfeatureslist />

import Generalattributes from "../\_generalattributes.mdx";

<Generalattributes />

### Settings for the User interface only

#### `settings.layout.type` (User interface only)

Which layout to use for the _My applications_ view. Defaults to `row`. Choices: `row`, `2-column`, `3-column`

**Example**:

The following screenshot shows the syntax for setting several attributes for a brand: light mode, a 3-column display of applications on My Applications page, hiding the API drawer from the tool bar, and disallowing users to edit the applications on My Applications page.
