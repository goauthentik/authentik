# Customization

Since flows can be executed authenticated or unauthenticated, the default settings can be set via brands _attributes_.

### `settings.theme.base`

Configure the base color scheme. Defaults to `automatic`, which switches between dark and light mode based on the users' browsers' preference. Choices: `automatic`, `dark`, `light`.
