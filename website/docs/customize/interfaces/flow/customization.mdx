# Customizate the flow

Because flows can be executed authenticated or unauthenticated, the default settings for all flows can be set via brands _attributes_.

You can define a background image [for one or more specific flows](../add-secure-apps/flows-stages/flow/index.md#flow-configuration-options), overriding the default background image for all flows that is set in the instance's [brand](../../../sys-mgmt/brands.md).

[Flow configuration options](../add-secure-apps/flows-stages/flow/index.md#flow-configuration-options).

### `settings.theme.base`

Configure the base color scheme. Defaults to `automatic`, which switches between dark and light mode based on the users' browsers' preference. Choices: `automatic`, `dark`, `light`.
