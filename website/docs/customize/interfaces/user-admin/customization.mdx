title: Customize the User and Admin interfaces
---

The authentik User interface and Admin interface can both be customized through attributes, defined in [Brands](../../../sys-mgmt/brands.md) under **Other global settings > Attributes**.

Most settings that are defined in the Brand's attributes are manifested in _both_ the User interface and the Admin interface, except for those marked below as either only for the Admin interface or only for the User interface.

## Custom settings

The settings are grouped by:

- `enabledFeatures` settings
- general configurations

### Enabling/disabling features

The following features can be enabled/disabled using attributes defined on the Brand. By default, all of them are enabled; to disable a feature, set the value to `false`, as shown in the screenshot below.

#### `settings.enabledFeatures.apiDrawer`

    Display the API Request drawer in the upper menu bar.

#### `settings.enabledFeatures.notificationDrawer`

   Display the Notification drawer in the upper menu bar.

#### `settings.enabledFeatures.settings`

    Display the Settings link in the upper menu bar.

#### `settings.enabledFeatures.applicationEdit` (User interface only)

    Application edit in library (only shown when user is superuser)

#### `settings.enabledFeatures.search`

    Display the Search bar in the upper menu bar.
