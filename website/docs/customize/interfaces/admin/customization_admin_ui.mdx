title: Customize the Admin interfaces
---

The Admin interface can be customized using attributes configured in the [Brands](../../../sys-mgmt/brands.md) section, found under **Other global settings > Attributes**.

Most attributes defined in a Brand apply to _both_ the User and Admin interfaces. However, any settings that are specific to only the Admin interface are explicitly noted as such below.

## Custom settings

The following settings are grouped by:

- `enabledFeatures` settings
- general settings (used on both the Admin interface and the User interface)
- Admin interface only

import Enabledfeatureslist from "../interfaces/\_enabledfeatureslist.mdx";

<Enabledfeatureslist />

import Generalattributes from "../interfaces/\_generalattributes.mdx";

<Generalattributes />

### Settings for the Admin interface only

The following settings can only be used to customize the Admin interface, not the User interface.

#### `settings.pagination.perPage`

How many items should be retrieved per page. Defaults to 20.

#### `settings.defaults.userPath`

Default user path which is opened when opening the user list. Defaults to `users`.

**Example**:

The following screenshot shows the syntax for setting several attributes for a brand: light mode, a 3-column display of applications on My Applications page, hiding the API drawer from the tool bar, and disallowing users to edit the applications on My Applications page.
