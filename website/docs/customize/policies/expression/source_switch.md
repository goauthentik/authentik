title: Switch which source is used based on email address
---

You can use an expression policy to determine which [source](../../../../users-sources/sources/) (a set of user credentials and data, stored in authentik, Google, GitHub, etc) is used for a particular user, based on the domain of the email address the user enters when they log in and authenticate.

To switch which source is used for a specific user based on their email domain, you need to 1. and then 2. bind that policy to the appropriate stage.

## 1. Create an expression policy

[Create](../working_with_policies.md#create-a-policy) an expression policy] that does the following:

    1. Maps the desired source for each user domain.
    2. Determines the user's domain based on their email address.
    3. Then "switches" the user to the desired source.

## Bind the policy to the stage

The new expression policy needs to be bound to the stage binding that comes after the Identification stage (or any custom stage that you might have created). For more information read our documentation about [bindings](../../../../add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/), and for instructions to bind a policy, see [Bind a policy to a stage]](../../../../customize/policies/working_with_policies/#bind-a-policy-to-a-stage).

## Example expression

```python
# This is a mapping of domains to sources
# the key is a domain for the user and the value is the `slug` of the source to redirect to
source_email_map = {
    "foo.bar.com": "entra-foo",
    "bar.baz.com": "entra-bar",
}

user_email = request.context["pending_user_identifier"]

_username, _, domain = user_email.partition("@")
source = source_email_map.get(domain)
if not source:
    return True
plan = request.context.get("flow_plan")
if not plan:
    return False
# For OIDC
# plan.redirect(f"/source/oauth/login/{source}/")
# For SAML
plan.redirect(f"/source/saml/{source}")
return False
```
