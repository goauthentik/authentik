## What are endpoint devices?

Endpoint devices are end-user devices or servers that are registered with authentik.

There are two purposes for registration: [Device authentication](./device-authentication/index.mdx) and [Device compliance](./device-compliance/index.mdx).

Devices can be registered by installing the [authentik Agent](./authentik-agent/index.mdx) which supports:

- [Device compliance](./device-compliance/index.mdx) by reporting information about endpoint devices to authentik
- [Local device login](./device-authentication/local-device-login/index.mdx) with authentik credentials
- [Connecting via SSH to endpoint devices](./device-authentication/ssh-authentication.mdx) with authentik credentials
- [Sudo authorization](./device-authentication/sudo-authorization.md) with authentik credentials
- [Authenticating to CLI applications](./device-authentication/cli-app-authentication/index.mdx) such as kubectl and AWS with authentik credentials

Alternatively, [Connectors](./device-compliance/connectors.md) allow authentik to be integrated with third party services like Fleet. This allows for device information to be reported to authentik for [Device compliance](./device-compliance/index.mdx) purposes.
