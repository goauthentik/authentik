:::danger
The Endpoint Devices featureset is currently in early preview stage and under heavy development. It is not recommended for production use.

This is a very early preview. The features, methods and even the name are yet to be confirmed.

Breaking changes and bugs should be expected.

## What are Endpoint Devices?

Endpoint Devices are end-user devices or servers that are integrated with authentik.

There are two categories or purposes of integration: [Device Authentication](./device-authentication/index.mdx) and [Device Compliance](./device-compliance/index.mdx).

Devices can be integrated by installing the [authentik Agent](./authentik-agent/index.mdx) which supports:

- [Device Compliance](./device-compliance/index.mdx) by reporting information about Endpoint Devices to authentik
- [Local device login](./device-authentication/local-device-login.mdx) with authentik credentials
- [Connecting via SSH to Endpoint Devices](./device-authentication/ssh-authentication.mdx) with authentik credentials
- [Sudo authorization](./device-authentication/sudo-authorization.md) with authentik credentials
- [Authenticating to CLI applications](./device-authentication/cli-app-authentication.mdx) such as kubectl and AWS with authentik credentials

Alternatively, [Connectors](./device-compliance/connectors.md) allow authentik to be integrated with third party services like Fleet and (TODO). This allows for device information to be reported to authentik for [Device Compliance](./device-compliance/index.mdx) purposes.

## Current featureset

The featureset is at varying levels of development.

### Device authentication

#### Local device login

:ak-enterprise
(maybe open-source for linux - needs testing)

#### SSH authentication / Remote authentication

Linux targets = open-source
Windows and macos targets = :ak-enterprise

Currently, only Linux hosts can be connected to via SSH.
SSH connections to macOS and Windows hosts, and RDP connections to Windows hosts is planned.

#### Sudo authorization

open-source?

Currently, only supported on Linux. (macos - need testing)

### Basic device compliance

open-source

Associating device with session
Basic agent facts

### Advanced device compliance

:ak-enterprise

More information

#### Connectors

:ak-enterprise

Connectors like Fleet, Entra, Intune etc

## Important Considerations
