The authentik Agent can be deployed on [Linux](./linux-workstation.md), [macOS](./macos-workstation.md), and [Windows](./windows-workstation.md) workstations.

It can also be deployed on [Linux hosts](./linux-host.md) to enable [SSH authentication](../../device-authentication/ssh-authentication.mdx) from other Endpoint Devices.

Documentation for large-scale deployments via [Mobile Device Management (MDM)](./mdm-deployment.mdx) tools is also available.
