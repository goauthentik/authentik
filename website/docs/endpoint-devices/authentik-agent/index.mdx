## What is the authentik Agent?

The authentik Agent is a service that can be installed on Linux, macOS, and Windows devices. It provides the folllowing capabilities:

- [Device Compliance](../device-compliance/index.mdx) by reporting information about Endpoint Devices to authentik
- [Local device login](../device-authentication/local-device-login/index.mdx) with authentik credentials
- [Connecting via SSH to Endpoint Devices](../device-authentication/ssh-authentication.mdx) with authentik credentials
- [Sudo authorization](../device-authentication/sudo-authorization.md) with authentik credentials
- [Authenticating to CLI applications](../device-authentication/cli-app-authentication/index.mdx) such as kubectl and AWS with authentik credentials

## authentik Agent components

The authentik Agent consists of several components:

| Platform                  | Component                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Dependencies                         |

| **Linux only**            | `libnss-authentik`                  | NSS Module that makes Linux aware of authentik users. All authentik users will be visible to Linux - but won't be able to login unless configured via device access groups. Provides a consistent `uid` and `gid` for users on all Endpoint Devices. | `authentik-sysd`, `libpam-authentik` |
| **Windows only**          | `Windows Credential Provider` (WCP) | Enables logging in to Windows devices using authentik credentials.                                                                                                                                                                                   | `authentik-sysd`                     |

## Technical information

All authentik Agent components communicate via gRPC and Unix domain sockets.

- `sys.sock` for general communication
- `sys-ctrl.sock` for "domain" join

## Important considerations

Sentry reporting is currently enabled by default and cannot be disabled. This will be configurable in a future release.
