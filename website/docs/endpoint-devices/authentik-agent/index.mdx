## What is the authentik Agent?

The authentik Agent is a service that can be installed on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It supports the following features:

- [Device Compliance](../device-compliance/index.mdx) by reporting information about Endpoint Devices to authentik
- [Local device login](../device-authentication/local-device-login.mdx) with authentik credentials
- [Connecting via SSH to Endpoint Devices](../device-authentication/ssh-authentication.mdx) with authentik credentials
- [Sudo authorization](../device-authentication/sudo-authorization.md) with authentik credentials
- [Authenticating to CLI applications](../device-authentication/cli-app-authentication.mdx) such as kubectl and AWS with authentik credentials

## authentik Agent components

On all platforms, Linux, macOS, and Windows, the authentik Agent uses the following core components:

#### authentik-cli

Provides commands for interacting with authentik-agent.

#### authentik-agent

User service.

#### authentik-sysd

System service.

### Linux hosts

Linux hosts that are connected to via SSH using the authentik Agent can use another two components:

#### libpam-authentik

PAM Module, which provides token-based and interactive authentication via authentik. Requires authentik-sysd running.

Authentication is only possible if Linux is aware of the authentik user, which can be achieved with [libnss-authentik](#libnss-authentik) or by manually creating user accounts that match the authentik users that need to authenticate.

#### libnss-authentik

NSS Module. Requires authentik-sysd running.

Makes the Linux host aware of authentik users.

## Important considerations

Sentry reporting is enabled by default and currently can't be disabled. This will be configurable in future.

Most of the AK CLI commands have a -v flag for verbose
