The authentik Agent is a service that can be installed on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It supports the following features:

- [Device Compliance](../device-compliance/index.mdx) by reporting information about Endpoint Devices to authentik
- [Local device login](../device-authentication/local-device-login/index.mdx) with authentik credentials
- [Connecting via SSH to Endpoint Devices](../device-authentication/ssh-authentication.mdx) with authentik credentials
- [Sudo authorization](../device-authentication/sudo-authorization.md) with authentik credentials
- [Authenticating to CLI applications](../device-authentication/cli-app-authentication/index.mdx) such as kubectl and AWS with authentik credentials

| **Windows only**          | Windows Credential Provider (WCP) | Enables logging in to Windows devices using authentik credentials.                                                                                                                                                                       | authentik-sysd                   |
