The authentik browser extension is required for device compliance functionality, and is currently available for Chrome-based and Firefox-based browsers.

The browser extension connects to the [authentik Agent](../authentik-agent/index.mdx). It supplies [device facts](./device-reporting.md#device-facts) that [stages](../../add-secure-apps/flows-stages/stages/index.md) and [policies](../../customize/policies/index.md) can use during execution of authentik [flows](../../add-secure-apps/flows-stages/flow/index.md). This enables device compliance functionality such as limiting access to applications based on operating system, see [device compliance policy](./device-compliance-policy.md) for more details.
