Connectors enable authentik to fetch device information from third-party tools like [Fleet](https://fleetdm.com/) and [Intune](https://aka.ms/intuneportal).

They can be used standalone or alongside the [authentik Agent](../authentik-agent/index.mdx).

Currently, the only supported connectors are the [authentik Agent](#authentik-agent) and [Fleet](#fleet)
