## Prerequisites

Device compliance functionality requires the following:

- [Configure authentik to support the authentik Agent](../authentik-agent/configuration.md).
- [Deploy the authentik Agent on the device](../authentik-agent/agent-deployment/index.mdx).
- [Deploy the authentik browser extension on the endpoint device](./browser-extension.mdx).

## Configuration verification

Verify that the endpoint device is reporting its facts on the [Devices](../manage-devices.mdx) page.

## Using device compliance

Now that the endpoint device is configured, you can create [device compliance policies](./device-compliance-policy.md) to control access to applications and more.
