Connectors allow device information to be reported to authentik. Connectors for third party services like Fleet can be used standalone or alongside the [authentik Agent](../../authentik-agent/index.mdx) connector.

## Available connectors

The following connectors are currently available:

- [authentik Agent connector](./authentik-agent.md) - Integrates with the [authentik Agent](../../authentik-agent/index.mdx)
- [Fleet connector](./fleetdm.md) - Integrates with [Fleet](https://fleetdm.com/) device management

Connectors are in development for Entra, Intune, Cloudflare WARP and other services.
