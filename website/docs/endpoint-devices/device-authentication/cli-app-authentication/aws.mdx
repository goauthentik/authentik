You can use the authentik Agent to authenticate to the AWS CLI with authentik credentials.

## Prerequisites

- The [authentik Agent deployed on it](../../authentik-agent/agent-deployment/index.mdx) must be deployed on your device.

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of authentik Agent with AWS CLI, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik for AWS CLI

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)
    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name (e.g. `authentik-aws-cli`), an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
        - Set the **Client type** to `Public`.
        - Set the **Client ID** to `authentik-aws-cli`.
        - Select any available signing key.
        - Under **Machine-to-Machine authentication settings** add the `authentik-cli` provider as a **Federated OIDC Provider**.
    - **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](../../../../add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage access to the application.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

### Configure AWS

- Open AWS dashboard
- Go to IAM
- Go to Identity Providers
- Click add
- Select OpenID Connect
- _Provider URL_: `https://authentik.company/application/o/authentik-aws-cli/`
- _Audience_: `authentik-aws-cli`

### Configure permissions in AWS

- Open AWS dashboard
- Go to IAM
- Go to Roles
- Create/edit a role you want people to be able to use
- Go to trust relationships
- Edit
- Add this, replacing `<account_id>` with your AWS Account ID

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<account_id>:oidc-provider/authentik.company/application/o/authentik-aws-cli/"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "authentik.company/application/o/authentik-aws-cli/:aud": "authentik-aws-cli"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Configure aws CLI to authenticate with authentik

Update `~/.aws/credentials`
Replace `<role_arn>` with the ARN of the role above

```
[default]
credential_process = ak auth aws --client-id authentik-aws-cli --role-arn <role_arn>
```

To verify, run `aws sts get-caller-identity`, which should output something like this

```json
{
    "UserId": "xxxxxx",
    "Account": "<account_id>",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::<account_id>:assumed-role/<role name>/<authentik username>"
}
```
