The authentik Agent can authenticate to CLI applications such as [`aws`](./aws.mdx) and [`kubectl`](./k8s.mdx).

## How CLI authentication works

First, `authentik-agent` and `authentik-cli` request an authentik token from the [authentik-cli OAuth Provider](../../authentik-agent/configuration.md#create-an-application-and-provider-in-authentik-for-cli) and exchange it for a token from the specified Kubernetes or AWS provider.

This token is cached until expiration. This improves performance by eliminating repeated token requests.
