The authentik agent can also be used to authenticate to CLI applications like [`aws`](./aws.mdx) and [`kubectl`](./k8s.mdx).

## How CLI authentication works

The initial step is that authentik-agent and authentik-cli request an authentik token from the [authentik-cli OAuth Provider](../../authentik-agent/configuration.md#create-an-application-and-provider-in-authentik-for-cli) and exchange it for a token from the specified k8s or AWS provider.

This token will then be cached until it's expired. This improves performance because a new token isn't requested for each authentication.
