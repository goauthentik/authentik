The authentik agent can also be used to authenticate to CLI applications like [`aws`](./aws.mdx) and [`kubectl`](./k8s.mdx).

(TODO)
agent and cli keeps a cache of tokens it has exchanged
initial step is that cli and local agent takes authenitk token and exchange this for specified k8s or AWS provider
then it will cache this until it's expired
this massively improves performance because it doesn't request a new token each time for authentication
