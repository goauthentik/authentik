You can use the authentik Agent to authenticate to `kubectl` CLI with authentik credentials.

## Prerequisites

- The device that you're using must have the [authentik Agent deployed on it](../../authentik-agent/agent-deployment/index.mdx).

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of authentik Agent with `kubectl`, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik for Kubernetes

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)
    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name (e.g. `authentik-kubernetes`), an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
        - Set the **Client type** to `Public`.
        - Set the **Client ID** to `authentik-kubernetes`.
        - Select any available signing key.
        - Under **Machine-to-Machine authentication settings** add the `authentik-cli` provider as a **Federated OIDC Provider**.
    - **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](../../../../add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage access to the application.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## Kubernetes configuration

To integrate the authentik Agent with your kubernetes deployment, you'll need to configure kubeadm.

### Configure kubeadm settings

Add the following `extraArgs` to your `kubeadm_config.yml` file:

```yaml
- name: oidc-client-id
  value: authentik-kubernetes
- name: oidc-groups-claim
  value: groups
- name: oidc-groups-prefix
  value: "oidc:"
- name: oidc-issuer-url
  value: https://authentik.company/application/o/<application-slug>/
- name: oidc-username-claim
  value: email
```

Run the following command to apply the changes to an existing Kubernetes cluster:

```sh
kubeadm upgrade apply <version> --config=kubeadm_config.yml
```

Where `<version>` matches the target Kubernetes version specified in your config file.

:::info Example config file
An example `kubeadm_config.yml` is available on the [authentik Platform GitHub repository](https://github.com/BeryJu/infrastructure/blob/main/roles/beryjuio_kube/templates/kubeadm_config.yml#L11-L20).
