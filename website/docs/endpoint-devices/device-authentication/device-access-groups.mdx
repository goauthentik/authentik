Device access groups are how access to endpoint devices is controlled. You can group devices as you see fit and then bind users, user groups, and policies that determine who is allowed to access those devices.

## Creating a device access group

To create a device access group follows these steps:

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Endpoint Devices** > **Device Access Groups** and click **Create**.
3. Provide a **Group name** and click **Create**.
4. Expand the newly created device access group.
5. Click either **Create and bind Policy** or **Bind existing Policy / Group / User**.
6. Once you've configured the desired access for the device access group, click **Finish**.
