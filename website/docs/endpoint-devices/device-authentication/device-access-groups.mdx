Device access groups control access to endpoint devices. You can organize devices into groups and bind users, user groups, and policies to determine access.

## Creating a device access group

To create a device access group, follow these steps:

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Endpoint Devices** > **Device Access Groups** and click **Create**.
3. Provide a **Group name** and click **Create**.
4. Expand the newly created device access group.
5. Click either **Create and bind Policy** or **Bind existing Policy / Group / User**.
6. Once you've configured the desired access for the device access group, click **Finish**.
