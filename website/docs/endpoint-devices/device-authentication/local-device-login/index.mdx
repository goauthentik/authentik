Local device login means you can log in to a device using authentik credentials instead of a separate local account.

Users authenticate with authentik, just like they do for web applications and other services. The operating system login screen on a laptop, desktop, or server is connected to authentik.

Local device login is currently only supported on Windows. The functionality should be supported on Linux, however configuration and testing with the various Linux login managers (SDDM, GDM etc) has not been completed.
