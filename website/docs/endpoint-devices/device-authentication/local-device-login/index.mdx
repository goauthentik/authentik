Local device login allows you to log in to devices using authentik credentials instead of separate local accounts.

Users authenticate with authentik, just like they do for any application. The operating system login screen on a laptop, desktop, or server is connected to authentik.

Local device login is currently only supported on Windows. Linux support is possible but not yet implemented. Configuration and testing with various Linux login managers (SDDM, GDM, etc.) and PAM implementations is pending.
