- [SSH authentication](./ssh-authentication.mdx) - Connect from one endpoint device to another via SSH.
- [Sudo authorization](./sudo-authorization.md) - Authorize sudo elevation on an endpoint device.
- [Authenticate CLI applications](./cli-app-authentication/index.mdx) - Authenticate CLI based applications like `aws` and `kubectl`.
