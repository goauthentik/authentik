It's possible to authenticate SSH connections using authentik credentials between Endpoint Devices with the [authentik Agent](../authentik-agent/index.mdx) installed.

Currently, this is only supported when the SSH endpoint is a [Linux host](../authentik-agent/agent-deployment/linux.md).

## How to SSH to an Endpoint Device

To SSH to a configured [Linux host](../authentik-agent/agent-deployment/linux.md) using the authentik Agent:

1. Open a Terminal session and run the following command:

    ```
    ak ssh <hostname>
    ```

2. If not already authentiacted, you will be prompted for authentik credentials.
3. The SSH session will connect.
