## What is authentik Platform?

[authentik platform](https://github.com/goauthentik/platform) allows you to authenticate to different systems and services using your authentik credentials.

It currently supports:

    - authenticating to [Linux hosts via SSH](./linux-host.mdx)
    - authenticating to CLI applications such as [`kubectl`](./kubectl.mdx) and [`aws`](./aws.mdx).
    - logging in to [Windows devices](./windows.mdx)

It can be installed on [macOS](./macos.mdx), [Linux](./linux.mdx) and [Windows](./windows.mdx).

Packages are available [here](https://pkg.goauthentik.io); a `.pkg` file for macOS, a `.msi` file for Windows and `.deb` packages for Linux.
