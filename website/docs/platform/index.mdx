## What is authentik Platform?

[authentik platform](https://github.com/goauthentik/platform) allows you to SSH to Linux hosts and authenticate using authentik credentials.

It can be installed on [MacOS](./macos.mdx), [Linux](./linux.mdx) and [Windows](./windows.mdx).

Packages are available [here](https://authentik-pkg.netlify.app/). It's deployed via a `.pkg` file for MacOS, a `.msi` file for Windows and `.deb` file for Linux.

## What is Windows Credential Provider

[Windows Credential Provider](./windows-credential-provider.mdx) is a component of authentik Platform that allows logging in to Windows hosts using authentik credentials.

It currently only supports local login; RDP login is not supported.
