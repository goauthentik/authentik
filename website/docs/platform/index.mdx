## What is authentik Platform?

[authentik platform](https://github.com/goauthentik/platform) allows you to authenticate to different systems and services using your authentik credentials.

It currently supports:

    - authenticating to [Linux hosts via SSH](./linux-host.mdx)
    - authenticating to CLI applications such as [`kubectl`](./kubectl.mdx) and [`aws`](./aws.mdx).
    - logging in to [Windows devices](./windows.mdx)

Packages are available [here](https://pkg.goauthentik.io); a `.pkg` file for macOS, a `.msi` file for Windows and `.deb` packages for Linux.

## authentik Platform components

On all platforms; Linux, macOS and Windows, authentik platform uses the following core components:

#### authentik-cli

Provides commands for interacting with authentik-agent.

#### authentik-agent

User service.

#### authentik-sysd

System service.

## Important Considerations

This is a very early preview of authentik Platform. The features, methods and even the name are yet to be confirmed.

Breaking changes and bugs should be expected.

The current deployment methods are only for early preview and do not reflect their final form.

Sentry reporting is enabled by default and currently can't be disabled.

Most of the CLI commands have a -v flag for verbose
