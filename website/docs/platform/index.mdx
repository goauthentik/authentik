## What is authentik Platform?

[authentik platform](https://github.com/goauthentik/platform) currently allows you to authenticate to Linux servers via SSH and CLI applications such as [`kubectl`](./kubectl.mdx) and [`aws`](./aws.mdx).

It can be installed on [macOS](./macos.mdx), [Linux](./linux.mdx) and [Windows](./windows.mdx).

Packages are available [here](https://authentik-pkg.netlify.app/); a `.pkg` file for macOS, a `.msi` file for Windows and `.deb` packages for Linux.

## What is Windows Credential Provider

[Windows Credential Provider](./windows-credential-provider.mdx) is a component of authentik Platform that allows logging in to Windows workstations using authentik credentials.

It currently only supports local login; RDP login is not supported.
