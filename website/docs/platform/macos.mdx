## What does it do

Allows you to SSH to Linux hosts using authentik credentials.

## Install Platform

Follow these steps to install authentik Platform on your macOS client:

1. Open the [authentik Platform Packages](https://pkg.goauthentik.io) page.
2. Under **Desktop packages** click on **macOS** to download the macOS package.
3. Once the download is complete, attempt to install the package. Default Apple security settings should block the install.
   This can be avoided by Option + Right Clicking the package and clicking **Open**. Alternatively use the following command to remove the package from quarantine `xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/authentik\ agent\ installer.pkg`.
4. If prompted, enter your login password and click OK. You should now be able to install the package.
5. Continue through the installation wizard steps.
6. Confirm that authentik Platform is installed by opening a Terminal window and entering the following command: `ak`
   You should see a response that starts with: `authentik CLI v<version_number>`

## Configure Platform

1. Open a Terminal session and run the following command:

```sh
ak config setup --authentik-url <authentik_FQDN>
```

2. A browser will open and direct you to the authentik login page. Once authenticated, Platform will be configured.

## Usage

To SSH to a [Linux host](./linux-host.mdx) via authentik Platform:

1. Open a Terminal window and run the following command:

    ```sh
    ak ssh <hostname>
    ```

2. You will be prompted to authenticate with your macOS password or biometrics.
3. Once authenticated, the SSH session will connect.
