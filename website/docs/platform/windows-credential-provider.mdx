## What is Windows Credential Provider?

Windows Credential Provider is a component of authentik Platform that allows logging in to Windows workstations using authentik credentials.

It currently only supports local login; RDP login is not supported.

## authentik configuration

To support the deployment of Windows Credential Provider, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik for CLI

If you have already deployed the authentik OAuth CLI application/provider pair, skip to the next section.

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)
    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name (e.g. `authentik-cli`), an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
        - Set the **Client type** to `Public`.
        - Set the **Client ID** to `authentik-cli`.
        - Select any available signing key.
    - **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](../add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage access to the application.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.
