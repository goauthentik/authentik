## What does it do

Allows you to SSH to the Linux host using authentik credentials from another device via authentik Platform {WIP}.

## Platform components on Linux

### authentik-cli

Provides commands for interacting with authentik-agent.

### authentik-agent

User service.

### authentik-sysd

System service.

### libpam-authentik

PAM Module. Requires authentik-sysd running.

### libnss-authentik

NSS Module. Requires authentik-sysd running.

## authentik configuration

To support the deployment of authentik Platform, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)
    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
        - Note the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **slug** values because they will be required later.
        - Set a `Strict` redirect URI to `????????`.
        - Select any available signing key.
    - **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## Host configuration

Now you'll need to install and configure authentik Platform on your Linux host.
