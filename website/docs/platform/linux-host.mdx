## What does it do

Allows you to SSH to a Linux host using authentik credentials from another device via authentik Platform {WIP}.

## Platform components on Linux

### authentik-cli

Provides commands for interacting with authentik-agent.

### authentik-agent

User service.

### authentik-sysd

System service.

### libpam-authentik

PAM Module, which provides token-based and interactive authentication via authentik. Requires authentik-sysd running.

Authentication is only possible if Linux is aware of the authentik user, which can be achieved with [libnss-authentik](#libnss-authentik) or by manually creating user accounts that match the authentik users that need to authenticate.

### libnss-authentik

NSS Module. Requires authentik-sysd running.

Makes the Linux host aware of authentik users.

## authentik configuration

To support the deployment of authentik Platform, you need to import the OAuth device code flow and create two application/provider pairs, a service account and a token in authentik.

### Create OAuth device code flow

If you have already deployed the authentik OAuth device code flow, skip to the next section.

1. Download the device code flow blueprint [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goauthentik/platform/refs/heads/main/hack/authentik/blueprints/oauth2-device-code.yaml).
2. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
3. Navigate to **Flows and Stages** > **Flows**.
4. Click **Import**
5. Select the downloaded blueprint and click **Import**.

Alternatively, manually create the flow by following the instructions in the [Device code flow documentation](https://docs.goauthentik.io/add-secure-apps/providers/oauth2/device_code/#create-and-apply-a-device-code-flow)

### Create an application and provider in authentik for CLI

If you have already deployed the authentik OAuth CLI application/provider pair, skip to the next section.

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)
    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name (e.g. `authentik-cli`), an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
        - Set the **Client type** to `Public`.
        - Set the **Client ID** to `authentik-cli`.
        - Select any available signing key.
    - **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](../add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage access to the application.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

### Create an application and provider in authentik for PAM

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)
    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name (e.g. `authentik-pam`), an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
        - Set the **Client type** to `Public`.
        - Set the **Client ID** to `authentik-pam`.
        - Select any available signing key.
        - Under **Machine-to-Machine authentication settings** select the previously created `authentik-cli` provider as a **Federated OIDC Provider**.
    - **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](../docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage access to the application.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

### Create a service account

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Directory** > **Users**.
3. Click **Create Service account** and configure the following fields:
    - **Username**: provide a username for the service account
    - **Create group**: disabled
    - **Expiring**: disabled
4. Click **Create**.

### Create a token

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Directory** > **Token and App passwords** and click **Create** and set the following configuration:
    - **Identifier**: provide a unique name for the token
    - **User**: the service account created in the previous section
    - **Intent**: `API Token`
    - **Expiring**: disabled

3. Click **Create**.
4. In the **Actions** column next to the newly created token, click the **Copy token** icon. Securely store the token as it will be required in the next section.

## Host configuration

Now you'll need to install and configure authentik Platform on the Linux host that you want to SSH to.

### Install Platform

1. Open a Terminal session and install the required GPG key:

    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://pkg.goauthentik.io/keys/gpg-key.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/authentik-keyring.gpg
    ```

2. Add the repository:

    ```sh
    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/authentik-keyring.gpg] https://pkg.goauthentik.io stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/authentik.list
    ```

3. Update your repositories and install the authentik Platform Packages:

    ```sh
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install authentik-cli authentik-sysd libpam-authentik libnss-authentik
    ```

4. Confirm that authentik Platform is installed by entering the following command: `ak`
   You should see a response that starts with: `authentik CLI v<version_number>`

### Configure Platform

1. Open a Terminal session and run the following command:

    ```sh
    ak-sysd domains join <domain_name> -d <app_name_in_authentik> -a <authentik_FQDN>
    ```

- `<domain_name>` is a name for the authentik instance (e.g. `authentik-Prod`).
- `<app_name_in_authentik>` is the name of the application created in authentik (e.g. `authentik-pam`).
- `<authentik_FQDN>` is the FQDN of your authentik instance.

2. You will be prompted for a token, enter the token that you previously created.
3. To confirm that platform is configured correctly, run the `ak-sysd check` command. This outputs the status of all Platform components.
