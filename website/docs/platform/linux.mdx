## What does it do

Allows you to SSH to Linux hosts using authentik credentials.

## Install Platform

Follow these steps to install authentik Platform on your Linux client:

1. Open a Terminal session and install the required GPG key:

    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://authentik-pkg.netlify.app/keys/gpg-key.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/authentik-keyring.gpg
    ```

2. Add the repository:

    ```sh
    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/authentik-keyring.gpg] https://authentik-pkg.netlify.app/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/authentik.list
    ```

3. Update your repositories and install the authentik Platform Package:

    ```sh
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install authentik-cli authentik-agent authentik-sysd
    ```

4. Confirm that authentik Platform is installed by entering the following command: `ak`
   You should see a response that starts with: `authentik CLI v<version_number>`

## Usage

To SSH to a [Linux host](./linux-host.mdx) via authentik Platform:

1. Open a Terminal session and run the following command:

    ```
    ak ssh <hostname>
    ```

2. A browser will open and direct you to the authentik login page. Once authenticated, the SSH session will connect.
