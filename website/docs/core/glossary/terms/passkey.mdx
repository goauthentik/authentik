    shortDescription: Discoverable FIDO2 credential, often synced across devices for passwordless login.
    longDescription: A user‑friendly form of WebAuthn credential stored by a platform or password manager and typically synced via cloud. Passkeys allow username‑less and passwordless flows by discovering credentials on the device. All passkeys are WebAuthn, but not all WebAuthn credentials are passkeys (e.g., non‑resident).
