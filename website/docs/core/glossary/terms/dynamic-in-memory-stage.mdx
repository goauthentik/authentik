    shortDescription: Ephemeral stage appended at runtime; exists only in memory.
    longDescription: Special stage added by authentik in specific contexts to alter control flow without persisting configuration. For example, the Source stage appends a dynamic in-memory stage to the source's flow to suspend the current flow, run the source's authentication or enrollment, and then resume. If a User login stage is bound in the source's flow, it will directly authenticate the pending user instead of resuming the original flow. Not configurable by administrators.
