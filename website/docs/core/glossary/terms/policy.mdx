    shortDescription: A yes/no gate evaluated by type and settings.
    longDescription: At a base level a policy is a yes/no gate. It evaluates to True or False depending on the policy kind and settings. For example, a Group Membership policy evaluates to True if the user is a member of the specified group and False if not. Policies can conditionally apply stages, grant or deny access, and support other custom logic.
