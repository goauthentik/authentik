Adding Facebook as a source allows users to authenticate through authentik using their Facebook credentials.

## Preparation

The following placeholders are used:

-   `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik install.

## Facebook configuration

To integrate authentik with Facebook and access the user credentials from Facebook, you first need to register with Meta for Developers and create a developers account. Refer to the [Facebook documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development) for exact steps.

1. Visit https://developers.facebook.com/ and log in to your Facebook account.
2. After you log in, go to https://developers.facebook.com/async/registration and follow the steps to register as a developer.

Next, create an app so that Facebook generates a unique ID for your authentik app.

:::info
You will need the Facebook **App ID** and **App Secret** values from the Facebook app in order to configure the authentik integration. See Step 11. below for instructions.
:::

3. On the Meta for Developers Dashboard click **Create**.
4. Follow the prompts to create the app.

After you create the app you need to customize the login settings.

5. Go back to the Dashboard and in the left navigation pane click **Use Cases**.
6. On the **Use cases** page, click **Customize** under **Authentication and account creation**.
7. On the **Customize** page, click **Go to settings**.
8. On the **Facebook Login settings** page set the **Valid OAuth redirect URIs** field to `https://authentik.company/source/oauth/callback/facebook/` and then click **Save**.

9. Navigate to the **Use cases -> Customize** page.
10. Under **Permissions** click **Add** for the **email** permission.

Next, you need to obtain the App ID and the App Secret for the Facebook app, and enter those into your authentik source configuration.

11. Go back to the Dashboard, and in the bottom left in the navigation pane, click on **App settings -> Basic**.
12. Copy the **App ID** and the **App secret** values and temporarily store them in a safe place until you enter them into authentik.

Finally, you need to publish the Facebook app.

12. Go back to the Dashboard, and on the **Create and publish this app** page, follow the prompts.

## authentik configuration
