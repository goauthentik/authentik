# CVE-2025-29928

## Deletion of sessions did not revoke sessions when using database session storage

### Summary

When authentik was configured to use the database for session storage (which is a non-default setting), deleting sessions via the Web Interface or the API would not revoke the session and the session holder would continue to have access to authentik.

This also affects automatic session deletion when a user is set to inactive or a user is deleted.

### Patches

authentik 2025.2.3 and 2024.12.4 fix this issue.

### Workarounds

Switching to the cache-based session storage until the authentik instance can be upgraded is recommended.
