# CVE-2025-29928

## Deletion of sessions did not revoke sessions when using database session storage

### ADDENDUM May 30, 2025

As of version 2025.4, the option to store sessions in cache has been removed; sessions are now exclusively stored in the database. See our [2025.4 release notes](../../releases/2025/v2025.4.md#sessions-are-now-stored-in-the-database) for more information.

### Summary

When authentik was configured to use the database for session storage (which is a non-default setting), deleting sessions via the Web Interface or the API would not revoke the session and the session holder would continue to have access to authentik.

This also affects automatic session deletion when a user is set to inactive or a user is deleted.

The session backend was configured via the `AUTHENTIK_SESSION_STORAGE` setting, which was removed in version 2025.4.

### Patches

authentik 2025.2.3 and 2024.12.4 fix this issue.

### Workarounds

Switching to the cache-based session storage until the authentik instance can be upgraded is recommended. This will however also delete all existing sessions and users will have to re-authenticate.
