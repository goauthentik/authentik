# CVE-2025-52553

_Reported by [SPIEGEL-Verlag](https://gruppe.spiegel.de)_

## Insufficient Session verification for Remote Access Control endpoint access

### Summary

After authorizing access to a RAC endpoint, authentik creates a token which is used for a single connection and is sent to the client in the URL. This token is intended to only be valid for the session of the user who authorized the connection, however this check is currently missing.

### Patches

authentik 2025.4.3 and 2025.6.3 fix this issue.

### Impact

When for example using RAC during a screenshare, a malicious user could access the same session by copying the URL from the shown browser.

### Workarounds

As a workaround it is recommended to decrease the duration a token is valid for (in the RAC Provider settings, set **Connection expiry** to `minutes=5` for example). We also recommend enabling the option **Delete authorization on disconnect**.
