# CVE-2024-38371

_Reported by Stefan Zwanenburg_

## Insufficient access control for OAuth2 Device Code flow

### Impact

Due to a bug, access restrictions assigned to an application were not checked when using the OAuth2 Device code flow. This could potentially allow users without the correct authorization to get OAuth tokens for an application, and access the application.

### Patches

authentik 2024.6.0, 2024.4.3 and 2024.2.4 fix this issue, for other versions the workaround can be used.

### Workarounds

As authentik flows are still used as part of the OAuth2 Device code flow, it is possible to add access control to the configured flows.
