In technical docuemntation, there are document "types" (similar to how there are data types).

The most common types are:

-   [**Procedural**](./procedural.md): these are How To docs, the HOW information, with step-by-step instructions for accomplishing a task. This is what most people are looking for when they open the docs... and best practice is to separate the procedural docs from long, lengthy conceptual or reference docs.

-   **Conceptual**: these docs provide the WHY information, and explain when to use a feature (or when not to!), and general concepts behind the feature or functioanlity.

-   **Reference**: this is typically tables or lists of reference information, such as configuration values, or most commmonly APIs.

We have templates for the different types, to make it super-easy for whomever wants to contribute some documentation!
