title: "Conceptual topic"
---

Use a title that focuses on the feature, component, or technolgy you are writing about... for example, "About authentik polices" or "Understanding outposts". For conceptual docs, the verb in the title should indicate a concept, such as "About" or "Overview" or "Understanding", followed by the noun (the component or object you are writing about).

In this first section, immediately after the title, write one or two sentences about the feature, component, or technolgy. The following sections can help break up the content.

## Common use cases (optional section)

In this optional section, provide some example use cases for the feature. Who would use it, WHY? If you mention HOW to use the feature, be sure to link off to the related procedural doc. Also share situations where users might NOT want to use the feature; for example, if the feature is intended for a specific environment.

## Overview of feature/component

Dive deeper into explaining the concepts behind the feature/component.

> Pro Tip: If you were writing the related procedural topic, and you found that you had a lot to say about the topic, this is exactly where that info would go (not crowded up at the top of the procedural topic!).

Cover anything the user needs to know about the feature. If there are Reference docs for this feature or component, be sure to link to them from this page.
