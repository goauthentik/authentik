## Join us for our first authentik hackathon!

Everyone welcome; we will work on code, docs, and anything else that looks interesting and challenging.

Moderators will be available for most US and European hours, so if during the multi-day event, participants have questions or a PR needs a technical review, we are here for you.

Swag? Why, Yes! From cool authentik socks to food certificates, and indoubtibly GitHub fame, we've got you covered.

## Date

July 26-30, 2023
