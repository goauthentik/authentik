## Join us for our first authentik hackathon!

Everyone welcome; we will work on code, docs, and anything else that looks interesting and challenging.

Moderators will be available for most US and European hours, so if during the multi-day event, participants have questions or a PR needs a technical review, we are here for you.

> More details will be added soon about the exact daily timeframes, for both European-based and US-based participants.

Prizes? Why, Yes! We've got a total prize pool of $5000 and a bunch of cool authentik-branded socks, food certificates, and indubitably GitHub fame.

## Date

July 26-30, 2023

## Where

Online, in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik), using [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/809154715984199690/1110948434552299673) for conversations, questions, and video calls.

## Registration form

Use the [Hackathon 2023 Registration Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc10MiK4li-SIY8SidhwFEwFbDcna-fio1xFY2nmimqXPPvLA/viewform) to let us know that you'll join us!

> If you know what you and/or your team want to work on, you can open an [Issue](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/issues) using our template for all hackathon Issues at any time (why not now?) and add the `hackathon` label. Then, when you register, enter the Issue number that you opened on your registration form. This way, on Kickoff Day we can easily match particpants with their Issue of interest.

## Agenda
