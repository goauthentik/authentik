## Join us for our first authentik hackathon!

Everyone welcome; we will work on code, docs, and anything else that looks interesting and challenging.

Moderators will be available for most US and European hours, so if during the multi-day event, participants have questions or a PR needs a technical review, we are here for you.

Prizes? Why, Yes! We've got a total prize pool of $5000 and a bunch of cool authentik-branded socks and, indubitably, GitHub fame.

## Where

Online, in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik), and on Discord in our [#hackathon23 channel](https://discord.com/channels/809154715984199690/1110948434552299673) for our Kickoff call, checkins, and the wrap-up and awards events. We will also use the #hackathon23 channel throughout the entire five days, for questions and general chatting. Be sure to first visit our [welcome-info-rules channel](https://discord.com/channels/809154715984199690/813452440660606986), to review our code of conduct and see the latest posts about the hackathon.

## Take a look on GitHub

If you already know what you and/or your team want to work on, you can open an [Issue](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/issues) using our template for all hackathon Issues at any time (why not now?) and add the `hackathon` label. Then, when you register, enter the Issue number that you opened on your registration form. This way, on Kickoff Day we can easily match particpants with their Issue of interest.

During the Kickoff call, there will be time to peruse existing Issues and add emotes to indicate your interest in working on it (or having it worked on!)
