title: Full development environment
---

## Requirements

-   Python 3.11
-   poetry, which is used to manage dependencies, and can be installed with `pip install poetry`
-   Go 1.18
-   PostgreSQL (any recent version will do)
-   Redis (any recent version will do)
-   Node 16 (or later)

## Services Setup

For PostgreSQL and Redis, you can use the docker-compose file in `scripts/`.
You can also use a native install, if you prefer.

## Backend Setup

```shell
poetry shell # Creates a python virtualenv, and activates it in a new shell
poetry install # Install all required dependencies, including development dependencies
```

:::info
Depending on platform, some native dependencies might be required. On macOS, run `brew install libxmlsec1 libpq`, and for the CLI tools `brew install postgresql redis node@18`
:::

To configure authentik to use the local databases, we need a local config file. This file can be generated by running `make gen-dev-config`.

To apply database migrations, run `make migrate`. This is needed after the initial setup, and whenever you fetch new source from upstream.

Generally speaking, authentik is a Django application, ran by gunicorn, proxied by a Go application. The Go application serves static files.

Most functions and classes have type-hints and docstrings, so it is recommended to install a Python Type-checking Extension in your IDE to navigate around the code.

Before committing code, run `make lint` to ensure your code is formatted well. This also requires `pyright`, which is installed in the `web/` folder to make dependency management easier.

Run `make gen` to generate an updated OpenAPI document for any changes you made.

## Frontend Setup

By default, no compiled bundle of the frontend is included so this step is required even if you're not developing for the UI.

To build the UI once, run `make web-build`.

Alternatively, if you want to live-edit the UI, you can run `make web-watch` instead.
This will immediately update the UI with any changes you make so you can see the results in real time without needing to rebuild.

To format the frontend code, run `make web`.

## Running

Now that the backend and frontend have been setup and built, you can start authentik by running `ak server`. authentik should now be accessible at `http://localhost:9000`.
