# Docsmg

This CLI tool is used to generate a mapping file (`migratefile`) that is then used by the tool to migrate `.md`, `.mdx`, and images file from their current structure into a new structure.

Use this migration tool to:

-   generate the mapping file with the current structure
-   read the completed (manual process to define target structure) and create the directories and move the files.
-   modify the internal, cross-reference links to point to new location
-   write to the `netlify.toml` file to add redirect entries for all migrated files.

## Steps to install

1. Verify that you have the latest version of rust installed
    - Install [rust](rustup.rs) or update rust to the latest version with `rustup update`
    - If installing rust from scratch, you may need to run `. $HOME/.cargo/env`
2. Install the cli tool with `cargo install --git https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik --bin docsmg`
3. In the `/website` directory, create a file named `docsmg.env` with the entry of `MIGRATE_PATH=./docs`.

## Steps to use

### Create the mapping file (`migratefile`)

1. Navigate to the `authentik/website` dir.
2. Generate a migratefile with `docsmg generate | sort  >> migratefile`.
   You can also just run `docsmg generate | sort` to see the output in the terminal, before writing it to a file.

    :::info The new `migratefile` will be created in the `/website` dir.
    :::

3. Edit the `migratefile` to add the target directory paths in the new structure for each entry.
   For each file listed in `migratefile` insert the path you want to move them to.
   EXAMPLE: `path/to/move/from/file.md -> path/to/move/to/file.md`

    Note: make sure to put spaces on either side of the arrow or that line won't be recognized.

### Migrate the docs

1. After you have entered all the paths you want to move, migrate the files with the command `docsmg migrate`.

:::info
After you have run `migrate`, you cannot run it again or you will get a `panic` error... because the files have already been moved.
:::

2. To revert the migration, use `docsmg unmigrate`.
   Note: DO NOT edit the `migratefile` file before running `unmigrate`.
3. Continue modifying the `migratefile` file and then using the `docsmg migrate` command until you are satisfied with the result.

### Update the `sidebar.js file`

Because the structure is completely changed, you will need to modify/reconstruct the navigation bar.

## Test the results

To test the internal links, navigate up a level to `authentik` and then run `make website-watch`.

## Troubleshooting

-   If the `docsmg generate` command pulls _all_ of the files in the repo (even non-docs files), then check that:
    -   the `docsmg.env` exists
    -   that it is in `/website`
    -   the content is `MIGRATE_PATH=./docs`
