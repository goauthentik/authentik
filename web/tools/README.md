The `tools` folder is a junk drawer of all the tiny tools used to refactor this code in one way or
another. Given the frequency with which broad, system-wide syntactical changes need to be made,
having a way to keep and document _how_ those changes were made seems important. Having a collection
of those tools in this folder also means that future syntactical changes won't have to start from
scratch, there'll be some sort of framework in here that can be copied and adopted to whatever comes
next.

If you add a tool to this repo, please _date_ it so we can track when it was used, and if it's still
relevant to the development process.
