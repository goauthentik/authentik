# The Authentk.io Front-End

# Project Layout:

-   authentik/: Graphic Assets related to services
-   icons/: Application-specific graphic assets
-   src/: The application source
-   lingui.config.js: Lingui[^1] is an internationalization tool, using po/gettext format
-   rollup.config.js: This project uses rollup. That makes it an excellent target for vite.
-   tsconfig.js: Looks straightforward, although it does have paths, which means ts-alias will be
    needed.
