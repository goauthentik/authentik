# #Test files for OpenID Conformance testing.

These config files assume testing is being done using the [OpenID Conformance Suite
](https://openid.net/certification/about-conformance-suite/), locally.

See https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite/-/wikis/Developers/Build-&-Run for running the conformance suite locally.

Requires docker containers to be able to access the host via `host.docker.internal` and an entry in the hosts file that maps `host.docker.internal` to localhost.
